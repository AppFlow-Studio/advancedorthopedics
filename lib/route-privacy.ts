/**
 * Advertising-pixel eligibility policy.
 *
 * The boundary is PATIENT-SPECIFIC INFORMATION, not subject matter. Mountain
 * Spine publishes a large public library about back pain, herniated discs,
 * injections and surgery, and buys paid media against it. Those pages are
 * marketing content and must stay measurable. Treating the topic of a public
 * webpage as though it were a visitor's diagnosis would destroy legitimate
 * campaign measurement while protecting nobody.
 *
 * So the rules are deliberately narrow, and split by SURFACE vs SUBMISSION:
 *
 *   ROUTE (PageView)  — almost everything is eligible, including
 *                       /conditions/*, /treatments/*, /lp/*, /locations/*,
 *                       /blogs/*, /about/meetourdoctors/*, and the public
 *                       assessment landing pages. Landing on a page that
 *                       offers a symptom checker reveals nothing about the
 *                       visitor; it is an ad destination like any other.
 *
 *   SUBMISSION (Lead) — three workflows collect patient-specific clinical
 *                       answers, so completing one must not become an ad
 *                       conversion. See META_INELIGIBLE_FORM_SOURCES.
 *
 * Evidence behind the split (read from the form schemas, 2026-09-21):
 *   condition-check  — pain_area, pain_symptoms, pain_desc, pain_worst,
 *                      pain_source, insurance_type
 *   candidacy-check  — condition, age, health, smoking, recent_diagnosis,
 *                      last_test_date, insurance_type
 *   free-mri-review  — recent_diagnosis, last_test_date, insurance_type
 *
 * /patient-forms was previously excluded and should NOT have been: it is a
 * public page offering blank new-patient packets for download. It collects
 * nothing, uploads nothing, and is a legitimate marketing destination.
 */

/**
 * Path prefixes where no advertising pixel may run.
 *
 * Kept to the genuinely non-public surfaces. Authenticated patient areas would
 * belong here too — none exist in this application today. Deliberately NOT
 * listed: /conditions, /treatments, /patient-forms, /condition-check,
 * /find-care/candidacy-check, /find-care/free-mri-review, and every other
 * public marketing page.

 * Query keys that would carry a visitor's OWN clinical answers in the URL.
 *
 * Intentionally empty. A repository-wide audit found no route that encodes
 * patient-submitted health information in a query string: the three assessment
 * forms keep their answers in React state and POST them, and none of them reads
 * searchParams.
 *
 * What the audit DID find is `?data=<url-encoded JSON>` on /conditions and
 * /treatments — for example {"tags":["Neck","Spine"]} — linked from
 * HomePageUI, NavBar, ServicesAndExpertiseSection and HomeInteractiveAnatomy.
 * That is a PUBLIC CONTENT FILTER chosen by browsing, exactly equivalent to the
 * path /conditions/sciatica, which is eligible. Blocking one while allowing the
 * other was incoherent and cost real paid-media measurement, so `data` is NOT
 * listed here.
 *
 * This hook stays in place so a genuinely patient-specific parameter can be
 * excluded immediately if one is ever introduced.
