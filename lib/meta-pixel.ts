/**
 * Meta Pixel adapter — Mountain Spine & Orthopedics.
 *
 * Design rules, all deliberate:
 *
 * 1. LAYER SEPARATION. The application emits a neutral first-party success
 *    event (`lead_form_submit_success`, see lib/lead-contract.ts). This module
 *    is one *consumer* of that event. It translates it into the smallest legal
 *    Meta signal and nothing more. The site is the source of truth; Meta does
 *    not get to decide what a lead is.
 *
 * 2. MINIMAL PAYLOAD. Meta receives `Lead` / `Contact` / `PageView` with an
 *    eventID and an EMPTY custom_data object. No market, no clinic, no form
 *    name, no condition, no payer, no value. The site knows all of those; they
 *    stay first-party. Adding a parameter here is a privacy decision, not a
 *    convenience.
 *
 * 3. NO ADVANCED MATCHING. Automatic Advanced Matching is intentionally off in
 *    Events Manager. `init` is called with no user-data object, and no hashed
 *    or unhashed identity is ever passed. Hashed PHI is still PHI.
 *
 * 4. NEVER LOAD-BEARING. Every export no-ops on the server, without consent, on
 *    a sensitive route, or if the pixel failed to load. Nothing here may throw
 *    into application code — a blocked pixel or a Meta outage must never affect
 *    a patient's ability to submit a lead.
