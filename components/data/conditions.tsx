                Degenerative Disc Disease is a spinal condition caused by age-related breakdown of the discs that cushion the vertebrae. These discs act like shock absorbers, allowing your spine to flex, bend, and twist. Over time, discs can lose water content, flatten, and develop small tears, reducing their ability to support your spine and absorb impact. Unlike acute injuries, DDD develops slowly over time and is especially common in individuals over 40. However, it can also affect younger individuals with physically demanding lifestyles or spinal injuries.

                  To diagnose DDD, our specialists begin with a full medical history and physical exam, followed by advanced imaging such as X-rays or MRI scans to evaluate disc height, disc shape, and any signs of degeneration. We also assess nerve function and spinal alignment to understand the full extent of the damage. Diagnosis may involve ruling out other conditions, such as herniated discs or spinal stenosis, that share similar symptoms.

                Symptoms vary depending on the location and severity of the disc degeneration. Common signs include chronic lower back or neck pain that worsens with bending, twisting, or prolonged sitting. Some patients find relief when walking or changing positions. Others may experience muscle weakness or numbness in the arms or legs if nerve compression occurs. Many people also report stiffness or reduced flexibility in the spine. The pain may be intermittent, flaring up during activity and easing with rest.

                You may be at higher risk for DDD if you are over the age of 40, smoke, or lead a sedentary lifestyle. A history of spinal injuries or trauma can increase your risk, especially if paired with poor posture or spinal misalignment. Genetic factors also contribute, and individuals with a family history of spine-related conditions are more likely to develop DDD. Identifying these risk factors early can help slow the progression of the disease and guide preventative care.

                At Mountain Spine & Care, we create personalized treatment plans tailored to your condition and lifestyle. Treatment options may include physical therapy to improve strength, flexibility, and posture, as well as medications like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and swelling. For patients with nerve irritation, epidural steroid injections can offer targeted relief. Other approaches may include chiropractic care or spinal manipulation therapy. In more severe cases, minimally invasive spine surgery may be recommended to stabilize the spine and relieve nerve pressure. Our goal is to relieve your pain and restore spine stability while avoiding unnecessary surgery whenever possible.

                Arthritis refers to inflammation of one or more joints. It’s not a single disease but a broad term used to describe over 100 different types of joint disorders. The two most common types are osteoarthritis (OA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), though others like gout, psoriatic arthritis, and lupus-related arthritis are also common.<br/><br/>
                The primary symptoms of arthritis include joint pain, stiffness, swelling, redness, and decreased range of motion. Over time, arthritis can lead to cartilage loss, bone erosion, and even joint deformity, particularly if left untreated.

                  Many patients describe arthritis as a dull, aching pain that worsens with activity or after periods of rest. Understanding the exact type of arthritis you have is critical for choosing the most effective treatment path.

                There are several major types of arthritis that affect people of all ages. Osteoarthritis is the most common and is caused by the gradual breakdown of cartilage, which cushions the ends of bones within a joint. As this cartilage deteriorates, bones begin to rub against each other, leading to pain and stiffness. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system attacks the lining of the joints, causing chronic inflammation, swelling, and joint erosion. Gout results from a buildup of uric acid crystals, often in the big toe, and leads to sudden, intense pain. Psoriatic arthritis is associated with psoriasis and can cause both joint inflammation and skin symptoms. Each of these conditions presents unique challenges and requires a tailored treatment plan to effectively control pain and prevent further damage.

                Lower back conditions can present in many ways, including radiating pain, stiffness, numbness, or tingling that travels through one or both legs. The severity and type of symptoms often depend on the specific condition and how far it has progressed. Conditions like herniated discs, spinal stenosis, osteoarthritis, and spondylolisthesis are among the most common causes of chronic lower back pain. If you’re experiencing numbness or tingling in particular, this may point to nerve compression which is often more serious than general discomfort and should be addressed immediately to prevent long-term damage.

Surgery is not always necessary for lower back pain. In fact, many patients experience significant relief through non-surgical treatments such as physical therapy, spinal injections, or medications that improve body mechanics and reduce inflammation. However, if conservative treatments fail or if there is significant damage to spinal discs or nerves, surgical intervention may be required. In those cases, our team specializes in minimally invasive procedures designed to reduce recovery time and improve outcomes.

                  The most effective way to prevent lower back pain is by maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Carrying excess weight places added pressure on the lower spine, accelerating disc degeneration. Poor posture and lack of physical activity can also contribute to spinal issues over time. Even habits like smoking or prolonged sitting can increase the risk of developing chronic back pain. Making simple changes, such as staying active and practicing good posture, can go a long way in protecting your spine.

      "detail": "Nerves travel through narrow anatomical corridors surrounded by discs, ligaments, muscles, and bones. Herniated discs, degenerative bone spurs, thickened ligaments, or acute swelling after injury can narrow these passageways and irritate or compress the nerve. In the spine, cervical nerve compression may trigger arm pain or tingling while lumbar compression often produces sciatica that radiates down the leg. Peripheral entrapments such as carpal tunnel syndrome arise when nerves are squeezed in limb tunnels. Persistent pressure disrupts nerve signaling leading to pain, altered sensation, and muscle weakness if untreated. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics evaluation begins with a thorough history detailing symptom onset, aggravating positions, occupational demands, and red flag signs like progressive weakness or bladder changes. A focused neurologic examination maps sensory deficits, reflex alterations, and motor strength. Complimentary high resolution MRI pinpoints structural causes whether disc herniation, stenosis, or soft tissue swelling while electromyography distinguishes nerve root compression from peripheral neuropathy. These data guide an individualized treatment strategy that addresses both inflammation and mechanical pressure.",

                  A pinched nerve occurs when soft tissue or bone compresses a nearby nerve root, interrupting its ability to transmit signals correctly. This can result in pain that radiates from the spine to the extremities, depending on the location of the compression. When the cervical spine is affected, symptoms often extend into the arms or hands. If the lumbar spine is involved, the pain can travel into the buttocks, legs, or feet.<br/><br/>
                  Common causes of nerve compression include herniated discs, bone spurs, spinal stenosis, and poor posture. Over time, continued pressure can lead to worsening symptoms and even permanent nerve damage if not treated properly.

                Several spinal conditions can lead to pinched nerves. Herniated discs are one of the most common causes. When the soft inner material of the disc bulges out, it can press against nearby nerves and cause pain, tingling, or numbness. Spinal stenosis, which involves narrowing of the spinal canal, is another major cause especially in older adults.<br/><br/>
                Bone spurs, often related to arthritis or spinal degeneration, can also contribute to nerve compression by invading space meant for nerves. In some cases, muscle tightness or repetitive strain from poor posture may also lead to a pinched nerve. Understanding what’s causing your symptoms is key to receiving the right care.

                A pinched nerve doesn’t have to control your life. With early intervention and the right treatment strategy, most patients experience relief without surgery. Non-surgical options may include physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medication, activity modification, ergonomic adjustments, and corticosteroid injections. When conservative care fails to relieve pressure on the nerve, minimally invasive surgical solutions such as microdiscectomy or foraminotomy may be considered.<br/><br/>
                At Mountain Spine & Care, our team uses advanced imaging and diagnostic tools to pinpoint the source of nerve compression and build a customized care plan. Whether you need non-invasive treatment or surgical intervention, we’re here to help you recover quickly and safely.

                A herniated cervical disc occurs when one of the discs in the neck region (cervical spine) becomes damaged. These discs are gel-like cushions that sit between the vertebrae and act as shock absorbers. Over time or due to injury, the outer wall of the disc can tear, allowing the inner nucleus to leak out and press against surrounding spinal nerves. This can lead to symptoms such as neck pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness in the shoulders, arms, or hands. Treatment options range from conservative therapies like rest and physical therapy to more advanced solutions, including cervical spine surgery.

                 Diagnosing a herniated disc begins with a medical history review and physical examination. Your doctor may recommend imaging tests such as X-rays, MRI scans, or CT scans to confirm whether a disc is bulging or ruptured. While X-rays can help rule out other causes of pain, MRI and CT scans offer the most accurate visualization of soft tissue and nerve compression. If a herniated disc is confirmed, treatment usually starts conservatively with rest, ice, and medication. If symptoms persist, surgical intervention may be recommended.

                 In the early stages of a cervical disc herniation, pain can often be managed with rest, ice, heat therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications. Muscle relaxants or prescription pain relievers may also be used. If pain continues, physicians may suggest physical therapy to help strengthen the surrounding neck muscles. In some cases, nerve root blocks or epidural steroid injections are used to reduce inflammation and nerve pressure. Our team at Mountain Spine & Care will help determine the best approach based on your condition.

               Cervical disc herniation can occur suddenly due to trauma or gradually as part of the aging process. The most common cause is wear and tear, which leads to disc degeneration. Over time, the discs lose elasticity and hydration, making them more prone to rupture. Other contributing factors include poor posture, obesity, repetitive strain, and spinal injury. In people over the age of 30, disc degeneration becomes more common, but even younger patients can suffer from herniated discs if their lifestyle puts excess stress on the spine.

               Several factors can increase your risk of developing a cervical herniated disc. These include being overweight, smoking, living a sedentary lifestyle, or engaging in activities that involve repetitive neck strain or heavy lifting. Trauma to the spine or poor posture while sitting or sleeping can also contribute. Herniated discs may present with a wide range of symptoms pain, numbness, tingling, and weakness in the arms or legs so it’s important to get evaluated by a medical professional if you suspect you may have this condition.

               Treatment for a herniated disc depends on the severity of the condition and the patient’s overall health. Mild cases often respond well to conservative approaches like rest, physical therapy, heat/ice, and anti-inflammatory medication. If these measures fail to provide relief, more advanced treatments such as epidural injections or surgery may be required. Surgical options typically involve removing part or all of the damaged disc to relieve pressure on the spinal nerves.

                Cervical spinal stenosis can cause a variety of symptoms depending on the severity and levels affected. Common signs include shock-like pain in the neck or arms, tingling sensations, arm weakness, numbness in the hands or fingers, loss of coordination, balance issues, difficulty walking, and in severe cases, loss of bladder control. These symptoms may suggest compression of the spinal cord or nerve roots and should never be ignored.

                At Mountain Spine & Care, we specialize in procedures that relieve spinal cord compression while preserving motion. For patients with multi level stenosis (typically three or more levels), we recommend cervical laminoplasty. This procedure opens the spinal canal and decompresses the spinal cord without the need for a multi-level fusion, preserving mobility in the neck.<br/> <br/>
                For patients with one or two affected levels, a decompression and artificial disc replacement is often ideal. This modern approach allows for motion preservation and avoids the long-term stiffness associated with spinal fusion. While multi-level fusion is sometimes used, it can leave patients with a permanently stiff neck, especially when four levels are involved. In contrast, laminoplasty provides the best option for multiple levels of compression without sacrificing mobility.

                Cervical laminoplasty is a motion-preserving surgery done through the back of the neck. During the procedure, the muscles are temporarily moved aside and small cuts are made in the lamina the bone protecting the spinal cord. These bones are then lifted and repositioned to create more space for the spinal cord, relieving pressure and reducing symptoms.<br /><br/>
                The key benefit of this procedure is that it retains the neck’s natural movement. Unlike fusion, which locks segments together, laminoplasty allows the bones to remain flexible. However, it’s important to note that while laminoplasty is excellent for relieving nerve-related symptoms like arm and leg pain or headaches, it is not intended to address central neck pain. For axial neck pain, artificial disc replacement may be the better solution.

                Most patients recover quickly after cervical laminoplasty. Many go home the next day, and in some cases, it may be performed on an outpatient basis. Pain typically improves by the third day after surgery. Since neck movement is preserved, stiffness is minimized, and mobility is encouraged early on, which further speeds up recovery.

                Signs of a lumbar herniated disc often start gradually but may worsen over time if not treated. The most common symptom is a sharp or burning pain that radiates from the lower back into the leg, often following the path of the sciatic nerve. Many patients describe the pain as electric or stabbing, and it may worsen when sitting for long periods, bending forward, or coughing. Some patients also experience tingling, numbness, or muscle weakness in the leg or foot on the affected side. In severe cases, the condition can affect walking or standing for extended periods, reducing your quality of life.

                The right treatment for a lumbar herniated disc depends on how severe your symptoms are and how much they impact your daily life. Most cases respond well to conservative care, including rest, heat and ice therapy, physical therapy, and anti-inflammatory medications. These methods aim to reduce nerve irritation, restore movement, and strengthen the muscles that support the spine. If pain persists or worsens despite these efforts, more advanced treatments such as spinal injections or minimally invasive surgery may be recommended.<br/><br/>

               If you’re experiencing symptoms of a lumbar herniated disc, there are several treatment options available depending on the severity of your condition. If your pain is mild and manageable, starting with home care and guided physical therapy can often lead to improvement. Applying heat or ice, taking anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen or naproxen, and making lifestyle adjustments like avoiding long periods of sitting or poor lifting techniques can help reduce strain on the lower back. Exercise programs that strengthen the core and improve flexibility are also an essential part of recovery.<br/><br/>
                When conservative care is not enough, surgical treatment may be necessary to relieve pressure on the affected nerves. Discectomy is a common procedure where the portion of the disc pressing on the nerve is removed to relieve pain. In some cases, a laminectomy may be performed to widen the spinal canal and ease nerve compression. For patients with severe disc damage, spinal fusion may be considered to stabilize the spine and prevent further injury.<br/><br/>
                Every patient is different, which is why the team at Mountain Spine & Care develops personalized care plans using the most advanced and least invasive techniques available. Whether your condition is new or has been ongoing for years, we’re here to help you get back to living the life you love.

Mountain Spine & Orthopedics provides precise diagnostics and targeted therapies supported by complimentary MRI reviews, free second opinions, and convenient car service to relieve sciatic nerve pressure, reduce inflammation, and restore comfortable pain free motion.",
        "detail": "The sciatic nerve is the body’s largest nerve, originating from spinal nerve roots in the lower back and traveling through the pelvis buttocks and down each leg. Herniated discs bone spurs spinal stenosis or inflammation can compress these roots, triggering radiating pain numbness or weakness that follows the nerve’s path. Sciatica is a symptom of an underlying issue that must be correctly identified for effective treatment. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics evaluation begins with a detailed history identifying pain onset activity triggers and previous spine or hip conditions. A focused physical exam assesses posture gait reflexes and straight leg raise response. Complimentary high resolution MRI pinpoints the structural cause—often a herniated disc or foraminal narrowing—while electromyography distinguishes true sciatica from peripheral nerve or muscular disorders. These findings guide an individualized care plan to relieve nerve root pressure and address biomechanical contributors.",

                  Sciatica symptoms usually affect only one side of the body, most commonly the lower back and leg. They often intensify while sitting and may include radiating pain, numbness, tingling, and muscle weakness in the affected leg. If the condition advances, it may begin to impact your ability to walk or perform daily activities. In some cases, tingling or numbness in the arms and legs could signal a more advanced orthopedic issue.

                  Most cases of sciatica respond well to conservative treatment, especially when the underlying condition compressing the sciatic nerve is addressed. Treatment may include anti-inflammatory medication, stretching exercises, heat and ice therapy, and physical therapy. These methods aim to relieve pressure, reduce inflammation, and restore mobility.<br /><br />
                  Only after conservative options have been exhausted is surgery considered. At Mountain Spine & Care, our board-certified orthopedic doctors are experts in treating sciatica. We offer advanced, customized care plans that many other practices are not equipped to provide.

                  Coccydynia is the medical term for inflammation or injury to the coccyx (tailbone), located at the bottom of the spine. Pain may occur while sitting, standing up from a seated position, or during bowel movements. It can be dull and persistent or sharp and stabbing.<br /><br />
                  The cause isn't always obvious, but common triggers include a traumatic fall, stressful childbirth, or prolonged pressure from improper sitting posture. Rarely, it may be due to a tumor in the coccyx region. If the pain persists or intensifies, it’s important to consult with a spine specialist.

                  Diagnosing coccydynia typically starts with a physical examination and discussion of your symptoms and medical history. Your doctor may gently press on the tailbone area to assess tenderness and rule out other causes of pain. In some cases, imaging tests like X-rays or MRIs are used to identify fractures, joint instability, or signs of inflammation.<br /><br />
                  Once diagnosed, your provider will recommend a treatment plan based on the severity and duration of symptoms.

                  In early cases, coccydynia can be managed with non-surgical treatment. This includes using a wedge or donut-shaped cushion to reduce pressure while sitting, increasing fiber intake, and using stool softeners to minimize discomfort during bowel movements. Over-the-counter anti-inflammatory medications and hot/cold therapy can also help reduce inflammation and pain.<br/><br/>
                  If the pain persists beyond a few weeks, stronger pain relievers, physical therapy, or injections may be recommended. Surgery (coccygectomy) is reserved for severe cases when all other options have failed.

                  Coccydynia can result from both sudden trauma and long-term strain. Common causes include:<br/>
                   <li> Falls or direct impact to the tailbone</li>
                   <li> Prolonged sitting on hard or unstable surfaces</li>
                    <li>Childbirth, especially when prolonged or difficult</li>
                    <li>Repetitive strain or poor posture In rare cases, bone tumors or infections may lead to coccyx pain, which is why imaging may be required when pain does not respond to treatment.</li>
