In addition to supporting orthopedic recovery, stem cell therapy has shown promising results in reducing joint pain, improving mobility, and restoring function in patients with chronic conditions. It is commonly used for sports injuries, degenerative joint disease, and age related musculoskeletal decline.",
      "what_sym": "Chronic joint or tendon pain, stiffness, slow healing after injury, reduced mobility, and early signs of arthritis or tissue degeneration. Patients seeking natural alternatives to surgery or who wish to enhance post surgical healing are also strong candidates.",
      "risk_fac": "Arthritis, tendon or ligament injuries, degenerative disc disease, joint instability, soft tissue tears, and age related musculoskeletal wear.",
      "diagnose": "Mountain Spine & Orthopedics uses detailed physical examinations and imaging such as high resolution MRI or ultrasound to assess joint and tissue condition. A personalized treatment plan is developed based on severity, age, and goals for recovery.",
      "treatment": "The procedure is performed in office under local anesthesia. Stem cells are typically derived from the patient’s bone marrow or fat tissue, processed, and injected into the damaged area with image guidance for precision. The process takes under an hour, and patients return home the same day.",
      "pain_info": "Most patients report a gradual but steady decrease in pain and stiffness over the following weeks as inflammation subsides and tissue regeneration begins. Long term relief often follows with continued functional improvement.",
      "prevent": "Ongoing rehabilitation and lifestyle modifications such as physical therapy, low impact activity, and anti inflammatory nutrition can help maintain the results of stem cell therapy and reduce the risk of further damage.",

At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, we offer TLIF surgery backed by complimentary MRI reviews, second opinions, and convenient car service to stabilize the spine, relieve nerve pressure, and restore long term function.",
      "detail": "TLIF is a minimally invasive spinal fusion technique where part of the damaged disc is removed through a posterior approach. A cage or spacer filled with bone graft is inserted into the disc space to restore disc height and promote fusion between the vertebrae. The area is then stabilized with screws and rods to ensure long term support. This procedure is commonly used when back pain, nerve compression, or instability has not improved with physical therapy, medications, or injections. TLIF allows for a more targeted, single sided approach compared to traditional fusion surgeries, reducing tissue disruption and recovery time.",
      "what_sym": "Chronic lower back pain, sciatica or radiating leg pain, numbness or tingling in the legs or feet, spinal instability or difficulty standing or walking, degenerative disc disease unresponsive to conservative treatment.",

      "diagnose": "At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, we perform detailed physical and neurological exams, along with high resolution MRI, CT scans, and standing X rays to evaluate disc integrity, alignment, and nerve compression. A thorough consultation helps confirm whether TLIF is the most effective option.",
      "treatment": "The surgeon makes a small incision in the back and accesses the spine through the foramen the space around the nerve roots. The damaged disc is removed, and a cage filled with bone graft is inserted into the disc space. Titanium screws and rods are used to stabilize the spine while fusion occurs. The procedure typically takes 2 to 3 hours, and many patients are up and walking the same day.",
      "pain_info": "By decompressing the nerves and stabilizing the spine, TLIF surgery often provides significant relief from nerve related leg pain and lower back discomfort. Pain is managed with medication and usually decreases as the spine heals.",
      "prevent": "Maintaining good posture, strengthening core and back muscles, avoiding repetitive bending or lifting, and participating in post surgical physical therapy can help prevent further spinal degeneration or adjacent level issues.",
      "schedule": "If you're living with persistent lower back pain or sciatica, schedule a consultation with Mountain Spine & Orthopedics today.
