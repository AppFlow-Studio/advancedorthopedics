  "body": "Revision spinal surgery addresses complications from prior spine operations, offering relief for persistent back or neck pain. Explore your treatment options with our specialists.",
  "detail": "Revision spinal surgery is a specialized procedure for patients who have had previous spine surgery but continue to experience pain, instability, or new symptoms. This complex operation aims to correct issues such as failed fusion, hardware problems, or recurrent nerve compression. It is considered when non-surgical treatments have not provided adequate relief, focusing on restoring spinal function and alleviating chronic discomfort from failed back surgery syndrome.",
  "conditions_treated": "Our surgeons address post-surgical issues like failed spinal fusion (pseudarthrosis), hardware complications (loose or broken screws/rods), excessive scar tissue (epidural fibrosis) causing nerve compression, post-surgical infection, adjacent segment degeneration, persistent disc herniation or stenosis, and progressive spinal deformity. Symptoms include chronic back/neck pain, radiating leg or arm pain, weakness, or numbness.",
  "procedure_info": "The process begins with a thorough consultation and review of previous surgical records and advanced imaging (MRI, CT scans) to pinpoint the cause of ongoing symptoms. Revision spinal surgery is performed under general anesthesia. The surgical approach is highly individualized and may involve removing or replacing prior instrumentation, decompressing nerves by removing scar tissue or bone spurs, and potentially performing or extending a spinal fusion to achieve lasting stability. Our surgeons utilize precision techniques, sometimes including minimally invasive options, to optimize outcomes.",
  "recovery_info": "Recovery from revision spine surgery is typically more extensive than an initial procedure, often involving a hospital stay of several days. Pain management is a key focus post-operatively. A structured physical therapy program is crucial, starting with gentle mobilization and gradually progressing to strengthening exercises. Activity modifications are necessary for several months to allow for optimal healing and bone fusion, if performed. Full functional recovery can take from six months to over a year.",

"body": "Ankle replacement, also known as total ankle arthroplasty, is an advanced surgical procedure designed to alleviate chronic ankle pain and restore function by replacing damaged bone and cartilage with a precision-engineered prosthesis. If severe ankle arthritis is limiting your mobility and making every step painful, this surgery offers a path to relief. By resurfacing the joint and implanting a specialized metal and medical-grade plastic device, ankle replacement aims to preserve motion and enable a more natural gait compared to traditional ankle fusion. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our fellowship-trained foot and ankle specialists leverage cutting-edge imaging and computer-guided alignment tools to personalize each ankle replacement, ensuring optimal outcomes for lasting comfort and mobility. We support our patients with complimentary MRI reviews, expert second opinions, and convenient car service.",
"detail": "The ankle joint, a critical weight-bearing structure, endures forces up to five times your body weight during walking and even greater forces during activities like running or jumping. Over time, factors such as previous significant injuries (e.g., fractures, severe sprains), inflammatory diseases (like rheumatoid arthritis), or degenerative 'wear-and-tear' (osteoarthritis) can erode the protective cartilage lining the tibia (shinbone) and talus (ankle bone). This erosion leads to painful bone-on-bone grinding, persistent swelling, and debilitating stiffness in the ankle. When non-surgical treatments—including medications, bracing, physical therapy, and activity modifications—no longer provide adequate symptom control, total ankle replacement surgery often becomes the most effective long-term solution for pain relief and functional restoration. Before proceeding with surgery, our expert team at Mountain Spine & Orthopedics obtains high-resolution, weight-bearing CT scans. These advanced images reveal the precise anatomy of your ankle joint and any subtle deformities. Based on this detailed information, we meticulously design a three-dimensional surgical plan. This pre-operative planning guides the precise positioning of the implant components to within fractions of a millimeter, ensuring optimal alignment, joint mechanics, and the longevity of the prosthesis.",
"conditions_treated": "Ankle replacement surgery is indicated for individuals suffering from end-stage ankle arthritis that has not responded adequately to conservative treatments. Specific conditions and symptoms that may lead to consideration for ankle replacement include: Severe and persistent ankle pain, particularly during weight-bearing activities like walking, standing, or climbing stairs. Significant ankle stiffness and a markedly reduced range of motion, making it difficult to flex, point, or rotate the foot. Chronic swelling, inflammation, and tenderness around the ankle joint. A noticeable grinding, clicking, or catching sensation within the joint during movement. Debilitating pain that interferes with daily activities, recreational pursuits, and may even be present at rest or disrupt sleep. Osteoarthritis of the ankle (degenerative joint disease). Rheumatoid arthritis or other inflammatory arthropathies affecting the ankle. Post-traumatic arthritis resulting from previous ankle fractures, dislocations, or severe ligament injuries. Avascular necrosis (osteonecrosis) of the talus, where a loss of blood supply leads to bone death and joint collapse. Failed previous ankle surgeries where arthritis has developed or worsened.",
"procedure_info": "Total ankle arthroplasty (ankle replacement) is a sophisticated surgical procedure performed by a specialized orthopedic foot and ankle surgeon. The primary goal is to remove the damaged cartilage and bone surfaces of the ankle joint and replace them with artificial components. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia or a regional nerve block. An incision is made at the front or side of theankle to access the joint. The surgeon then carefully removes the damaged ends of the tibia and talus. Using precise instruments and often computer-assisted navigation or patient-specific instrumentation (based on pre-operative CT scans), the bone surfaces are prepared to accept the prosthetic components. The artificial joint typically consists of two metal components that resurface the ends of the tibia and talus, and a medical-grade plastic (polyethylene) spacer that fits between them, allowing for smooth movement. These components are designed to mimic the natural motion of the ankle. The components may be press-fit into the bone for biological ingrowth or secured using bone cement. After ensuring proper alignment and stability of the implant, the incision is closed with sutures or staples, and a sterile dressing and a splint or cast are applied to protect the ankle during initial healing. The surgery generally takes a few hours, and patients may require a short hospital stay.",
"recovery_info": "Recovery after ankle replacement surgery is a gradual process that requires patience and adherence to the surgeon's rehabilitation protocol. Immediately after surgery, the ankle will be immobilized in a splint or cast to protect the new joint and allow for initial healing. Pain management will be a priority, often involving a combination of medications. Weight-bearing restrictions will be in place for several weeks (typically 6 weeks or more), meaning you will likely use crutches or a walker. Physical therapy is a crucial component of recovery, usually starting a few weeks after surgery once initial healing has occurred. Therapy will focus on gradually restoring range of motion, strength, balance, and normal gait mechanics. Swelling is common and can persist for several months; elevation and ice will be recommended. Full recovery, including a return to most daily activities and low-impact recreational pursuits, can take anywhere from 6 months to a year. High-impact activities like running or jumping are generally discouraged to preserve the longevity of the implant. Regular follow-up appointments with your surgeon will be necessary to monitor progress and the condition of the implant.",
"benefits": "The primary benefits of successful ankle replacement surgery include: Significant reduction or elimination of chronic ankle pain caused by arthritis. Improved range of motion in the ankle compared to pre-surgery or ankle fusion. Restoration of a more natural walking pattern (gait). Increased ability to perform daily activities and participate in low-impact recreational activities with greater comfort. Improved overall quality of life due to reduced pain and increased mobility. Preservation of motion, which is a key advantage over ankle fusion (arthrodesis) for many patients. Long-term solution for end-stage ankle arthritis, with modern implants showing good durability.",

"body": "Ankle arthroscopy is a cutting-edge, minimally invasive surgical procedure our specialists at Mountain Spine & Orthopedics use to diagnose and treat a wide range of painful ankle joint problems. By employing a tiny camera (arthroscope) and specialized micro-instruments inserted through small incisions, our surgeons can effectively address joint issues with significantly less pain, reduced scarring, and a faster recovery compared to traditional open surgery. We enhance this patient-focused approach with services like complimentary MRI reviews, expert second opinions, and convenient car service to ensure a seamless experience as we work to restore your ankle's function and relieve your pain.",
"detail": "Ankle arthroscopy, often referred to as 'keyhole surgery,' allows surgeons to visualize, diagnose, and repair problems within the ankle joint without the need for large incisions. During the procedure, the orthopedic surgeon makes one or more small portals (incisions) around the ankle. The joint is then gently filled with a sterile fluid, which expands the joint, providing a clear and magnified view for the arthroscope's high-definition camera. This camera transmits live images to a monitor, allowing the surgeon to meticulously inspect the articular cartilage (the smooth lining of the joint), ligaments, tendons, and the synovial lining. Through other small portals, specialized micro-instruments are introduced to perform the necessary treatment. This might involve shaving damaged or frayed cartilage, removing inflamed synovial tissue (synovectomy), trimming bone spurs that cause impingement, repairing or reconstructing torn ligaments, or addressing osteochondral defects (damage to cartilage and the underlying bone) by, for example, encouraging cartilage healing with biologic scaffolds. A significant advantage of this technique is that the surrounding muscles and tendons are largely undisturbed, which contributes to a quicker recovery. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our pre-operative planning often involves advanced imaging, including weight-bearing radiographs, high-resolution MRI, and, when necessary, CT scans. This detailed imaging helps us to plan each arthroscopic procedure with pinpoint accuracy, ensuring we effectively correct the underlying pathology while preserving as much healthy tissue as possible.",
"conditions_treated": "Ankle arthroscopy is a versatile procedure used to treat a variety of conditions that cause chronic ankle pain, instability, or mechanical symptoms when conservative treatments have failed. Conditions commonly addressed include: Persistent ankle pain, swelling, or stiffness not alleviated by rest, medication, or physical therapy. Chronic ankle instability and recurrent ankle sprains due to ligament damage. Ankle impingement syndrome (anterior, posterior, or soft tissue impingement) causing pain with certain movements. Osteochondral defects (OCD) or lesions (OCL) of the talus or tibia (damage to cartilage and underlying bone). Removal of loose bodies (fragments of bone or cartilage) within the ankle joint. Synovitis (inflammation of the synovial lining of the ankle joint). Diagnosis and treatment of cartilage damage or tears. Early stages of ankle arthritis (for debridement and symptom relief). Ligament tears or injuries requiring assessment and repair/reconstruction. Arthrofibrosis (scar tissue formation) limiting ankle motion. Unexplained ankle pain where diagnostic imaging has been inconclusive (diagnostic arthroscopy).",
"procedure_info": "Ankle arthroscopy is typically performed as an outpatient procedure, meaning you can usually go home the same day. It is conducted under anesthesia, which may be general anesthesia (you are asleep) or a regional nerve block (your leg is numbed). Once you are comfortable, the surgeon will make 2 to 3 small incisions (portals), each about the size of a buttonhole, around your ankle joint. A sterile saline solution is introduced into the joint to expand it and improve visualization. A small, fiber-optic camera called an arthroscope (about the diameter of a pencil) is inserted through one portal. This camera projects high-definition images of the inside of your ankle onto a video monitor. Guided by these images, the surgeon inserts specialized, slender surgical instruments through the other portals to perform the necessary repairs or treatments. This could involve shaving damaged tissue, removing inflamed synovium, trimming bone spurs, repairing cartilage, or addressing ligament issues. The specific steps depend on your underlying ankle problem. After the surgical tasks are completed, the instruments and arthroscope are removed, the fluid is drained, and the small incisions are closed with sutures or surgical tape and covered with a sterile dressing. A protective splint, boot, or cast may be applied to immobilize the ankle.",
"recovery_info": "Recovery after ankle arthroscopy is generally faster and involves less pain than traditional open ankle surgery, but it still requires a dedicated rehabilitation period. Immediately after the procedure, you will follow the RICE protocol: Rest, Ice, Compression (with an elastic bandage), and Elevation of the ankle to minimize swelling and pain. Pain medication will be prescribed to manage discomfort. Your surgeon will provide specific instructions regarding weight-bearing. For some minor procedures, you might be allowed partial weight-bearing in a protective boot fairly soon. For more complex repairs (like cartilage or ligament reconstruction), you may need to avoid putting weight on your ankle for several weeks, using crutches or a walker. Physical therapy is a critical component of a successful recovery. It typically begins within a few days to a couple of weeks post-surgery, depending on your surgeon's protocol. Your physical therapist will guide you through exercises to restore range of motion, reduce swelling, improve strength and stability, and eventually help you return to normal activities. Full recovery can take several weeks to several months, depending on the specific condition treated and the complexity of the surgery. Most patients can return to desk work within a week or two, but activities involving significant ankle stress will take longer.",
"benefits": "Ankle arthroscopy offers numerous benefits compared to traditional open surgery, including: Minimally invasive approach with smaller incisions, leading to less scarring and reduced soft tissue trauma. Generally less post-operative pain and discomfort. Faster recovery times and quicker return to daily activities and sports for many patients. Reduced risk of certain complications like infection and stiffness compared to open procedures. Improved diagnostic accuracy, as the arthroscope allows direct visualization of the entire joint. Ability to treat a wide range of ankle conditions effectively. Outpatient procedure for most cases, allowing patients to recover in the comfort of their home. High success rates for many common ankle problems, leading to significant pain relief and functional improvement.",
