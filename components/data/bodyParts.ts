      symptoms: "Spine conditions can manifest through a wide variety of symptoms that often depend on the specific location and severity of the problem. Common symptoms include persistent back pain that may radiate into the arms or legs, numbness or tingling sensations, muscle weakness, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Some patients experience sharp, shooting pain that follows nerve pathways, while others may notice a gradual onset of discomfort that worsens with activity. Neurological symptoms such as difficulty walking, loss of balance, or changes in bowel or bladder function can indicate more serious spinal cord compression and require immediate medical attention. The location of symptoms often provides important diagnostic clues—cervical spine issues typically affect the neck, shoulders, and arms, while lumbar spine problems commonly impact the lower back, hips, and legs.",
      whenToSee: "It's important to seek evaluation from an orthopedic spine specialist when back or neck pain persists for more than a few weeks, especially if it interferes with daily activities or sleep. Immediate medical attention is warranted if you experience severe pain following an injury, progressive weakness or numbness in your limbs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or if pain is accompanied by fever or unexplained weight loss. Patients who have tried conservative treatments like rest, exercise programs, or over-the-counter medications without relief should also schedule a consultation.

    intro: "The knee is the largest and one of the most complex joints in the body, bearing significant weight and stress with every step we take. Knee pain and conditions can dramatically impact mobility, work, sports, and quality of life. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our board-certified orthopedic specialists understand the intricate anatomy of the knee joint, which involves the interaction of bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and menisci. We diagnose and treat a comprehensive range of knee conditions, including osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, ACL and other ligament injuries, patellofemoral pain, and tendonitis. Whether your knee pain results from an acute sports injury, wear and tear over time, or a structural problem, our team provides personalized care that begins with accurate diagnosis through physical examination and advanced imaging. We prioritize conservative, non-surgical treatments whenever possible, including targeted exercises, medications, and injections, but we also excel in arthroscopic and advanced surgical techniques including knee replacement when surgery becomes necessary to restore function and relieve pain.",

      symptoms: "Knee conditions can produce a wide variety of symptoms that often depend on the specific cause and affected structures. Common symptoms include persistent knee pain that may be felt in the front, back, or sides of the knee, and stiffness that's worse in the morning or after prolonged sitting. Many patients experience swelling, which can be immediate after an injury or develop gradually over time. Some individuals notice clicking, popping, or grinding sensations in the knee, which can indicate problems with the meniscus, cartilage, or joint surfaces. Instability or a feeling that the knee is giving way is another common symptom, especially with ligament injuries. Reduced range of motion, making it difficult to fully bend or straighten the knee, is also common. Patients with knee conditions often experience pain that worsens with activity, especially walking, climbing stairs, or squatting. More serious symptoms that require immediate attention include sudden severe pain after an injury, complete inability to bear weight, visible deformity, or the knee locking in a bent position. The pattern and location of symptoms help our specialists identify which structures are affected and guide appropriate diagnostic testing.",

        q: "When should I consider interventional pain management procedures?",
        a: "Consider interventional pain management if you experience chronic pain that persists for more than three months despite conservative treatments like oral medications or exercises. These procedures may be appropriate when pain significantly interferes with daily activities, when conservative treatments haven't provided sufficient relief, or when you're seeking targeted, long-term pain control. We offer complimentary imaging reviews to help determine if interventional procedures are right for your condition.",

      {
        q: "What types of interventional pain management procedures do you offer?",
        a: "We offer a comprehensive range of interventional pain management procedures including epidural steroid injections for spine-related nerve pain, facet joint injections for joint-related pain, nerve blocks for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, radiofrequency ablation for long-term pain control, and targeted injections for joint and tendon conditions. All procedures are performed using advanced imaging guidance to ensure precision and safety.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long do pain management injections provide relief?",
        a: "The duration of pain relief from interventional procedures varies depending on the specific procedure, underlying condition, and individual factors. Epidural steroid injections may provide weeks to months of relief, while radiofrequency ablation can provide pain relief for 6-12 months or longer. Some patients may require a series of injections or repeat procedures for optimal results. Our specialists will discuss expected outcomes and follow-up care during your consultation.",

      {
        q: "Are interventional pain management procedures safe?",
        a: "Interventional pain management procedures are generally safe when performed by experienced specialists using advanced imaging guidance. All procedures are performed with sterile technique and precise image guidance to minimize risks. Potential risks vary by procedure and may include temporary soreness, bleeding, infection, or rare nerve-related complications. Our specialists will review potential risks and benefits specific to your procedure during your consultation.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I need an MRI before interventional pain management procedures?",
        a: "An MRI is often helpful, and sometimes necessary, before interventional pain management procedures to accurately identify the source of pain and guide procedure selection. MRI provides detailed images of soft tissues, nerves, and joints that help our specialists determine which interventional procedures may be most appropriate. Our practice offers complimentary MRI reviews. We can help coordinate MRI imaging if needed and use the results to develop a targeted pain management plan.",
