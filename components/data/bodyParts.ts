    intro: "The spine is one of the most complex and critical structures in the human body, serving as the central support system and protecting the delicate spinal cord. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our board-certified spine specialists understand that spinal conditions can significantly impact your quality of life, causing chronic pain, limited mobility, and neurological symptoms. We specialize in diagnosing and treating a comprehensive range of spinal disorders, from common conditions like herniated discs and spinal stenosis to complex deformities and degenerative diseases. Our approach prioritizes conservative, non-surgical treatments whenever possible, but we also excel in advanced minimally invasive surgical techniques when surgery becomes necessary. With state-of-the-art diagnostic capabilities, including complimentary MRI reviews, we provide personalized treatment plans tailored to each patient's unique condition and lifestyle goals.",

      symptoms: "Spine conditions can manifest through a wide variety of symptoms that often depend on the specific location and severity of the problem. Common symptoms include persistent back pain that may radiate into the arms or legs, numbness or tingling sensations, muscle weakness, stiffness, and reduced range of motion. Some patients experience sharp, shooting pain that follows nerve pathways, while others may notice a gradual onset of discomfort that worsens with activity. Neurological symptoms such as difficulty walking, loss of balance, or changes in bowel or bladder function can indicate more serious spinal cord compression and require immediate medical attention. The location of symptoms often provides important diagnostic clues—cervical spine issues typically affect the neck, shoulders, and arms, while lumbar spine problems commonly impact the lower back, hips, and legs.",
      whenToSee: "It's important to seek evaluation from an orthopedic spine specialist when back or neck pain persists for more than a few weeks, especially if it interferes with daily activities or sleep. Immediate medical attention is warranted if you experience severe pain following an injury, progressive weakness or numbness in your limbs, loss of bowel or bladder control, or if pain is accompanied by fever or unexplained weight loss. Patients who have tried conservative treatments like rest, exercise programs, or over-the-counter medications without relief should also schedule a consultation. Our specialists recommend early evaluation for conditions that may worsen over time, such as spinal stenosis or degenerative disc disease, as early intervention can often prevent the need for more invasive treatments later. We offer complimentary MRI reviews and free second opinions to help you understand your condition and explore all available treatment options.",

Our treatment philosophy emphasizes starting with the least invasive options, which may include targeted exercises, anti-inflammatory medications, targeted spinal injections, and lifestyle modifications. When conservative treatments don't provide sufficient relief, our surgeons specialize in minimally invasive spine surgery techniques that offer faster recovery times, less tissue damage, and reduced post-operative pain compared to traditional open procedures. We perform advanced procedures including microdiscectomy, laminectomy, spinal fusion, and artificial disc replacement, always prioritizing techniques that preserve spinal motion and function whenever possible. Our team works closely with each patient to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses not just the symptoms, but the underlying cause of their spinal condition, with the ultimate goal of restoring function and improving quality of life.",

    intro: "The knee is the largest and one of the most complex joints in the body, bearing significant weight and stress with every step we take. Knee pain and conditions can dramatically impact mobility, work, sports, and quality of life. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our board-certified orthopedic specialists understand the intricate anatomy of the knee joint, which involves the interaction of bones, cartilage, ligaments, tendons, and menisci. We diagnose and treat a comprehensive range of knee conditions, including osteoarthritis, meniscal tears, ACL and other ligament injuries, patellofemoral pain, and tendonitis. Whether your knee pain results from an acute sports injury, wear and tear over time, or a structural problem, our team provides personalized care that begins with accurate diagnosis through physical examination and advanced imaging. We prioritize conservative, non-surgical treatments whenever possible, including targeted exercises, medications, and injections, but we also excel in arthroscopic and advanced surgical techniques including knee replacement when surgery becomes necessary to restore function and relieve pain.",

      symptoms: "Knee conditions can produce a wide variety of symptoms that often depend on the specific cause and affected structures. Common symptoms include persistent knee pain that may be felt in the front, back, or sides of the knee, and stiffness that's worse in the morning or after prolonged sitting. Many patients experience swelling, which can be immediate after an injury or develop gradually over time. Some individuals notice clicking, popping, or grinding sensations in the knee, which can indicate problems with the meniscus, cartilage, or joint surfaces. Instability or a feeling that the knee is giving way is another common symptom, especially with ligament injuries. Reduced range of motion, making it difficult to fully bend or straighten the knee, is also common. Patients with knee conditions often experience pain that worsens with activity, especially walking, climbing stairs, or squatting. More serious symptoms that require immediate attention include sudden severe pain after an injury, complete inability to bear weight, visible deformity, or the knee locking in a bent position. The pattern and location of symptoms help our specialists identify which structures are affected and guide appropriate diagnostic testing.",
      whenToSee: "You should seek evaluation from an orthopedic specialist if knee pain persists for more than a few weeks, especially if it interferes with walking, sports, or daily activities. Immediate medical attention is necessary if knee pain follows a traumatic injury, if you experience sudden severe pain, complete inability to bear weight, visible deformity, or if the knee locks. Patients who have tried rest, ice, over-the-counter medications, or basic stretching without relief should schedule a consultation. Our specialists also recommend early evaluation for individuals whose knee pain is getting worse over time, is accompanied by swelling or instability, or if you notice limping. Early intervention can often prevent conditions from progressing and may reduce the need for more invasive treatments. We offer complimentary imaging reviews and free second opinions to help patients understand their condition and explore all available treatment options, ensuring you can make informed decisions about your care.",

We prioritize conservative, non-surgical treatments including targeted exercises focused on knee strengthening and flexibility, anti-inflammatory medications, and targeted injections such as corticosteroid injections, hyaluronic acid injections, or platelet-rich plasma (PRP) injections. For patients with chronic knee pain, we may recommend regenerative medicine options. When conservative treatments don't provide sufficient relief or when there are significant structural problems like large meniscal tears, advanced arthritis, or ligament injuries, our surgeons specialize in arthroscopic and advanced knee procedures including meniscal repair, ACL reconstruction, cartilage restoration, and knee replacement surgery using the latest techniques and implant materials. These procedures offer excellent outcomes with improved pain relief, restored stability, and faster recovery compared to older techniques. We work closely with each patient to develop a personalized treatment plan that addresses their specific condition, activity level, and goals, always prioritizing techniques that preserve joint function and motion whenever possible.",
