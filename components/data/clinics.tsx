            testimonial="As a healthcare professional, I understand spinal pathologies from treating patients with various musculoskeletal conditions daily. When my own L4-L5 disc herniation became debilitating, I researched every orthopedic center in Davenport, FL. Dr. Katzman's minimally invasive discectomy technique exceeded my professional expectations. I returned to treating patients pain-free within four weeks."

I'm back to full duty and leading my crew with confidence."
