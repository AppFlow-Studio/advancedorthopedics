    "adult-degenerative-scoliosis": [
      {
        question: "What causes adult degenerative scoliosis to worsen?",
        answer: "Adult degenerative scoliosis worsens due to the <strong>asymmetric collapse of spinal discs and facet joints</strong> caused by aging. As one side of a disc wears down faster than the other, the spine curves further, often leading to <a href=\"/conditions/spinal-stenosis\">spinal stenosis</a> and nerve compression."
      },
      {
        question: "Can adult scoliosis be treated without surgery?",
        answer: "Yes, the majority of adult scoliosis cases are managed non-surgically. Treatments include <strong>core strengthening exercises, bracing, and epidural steroid injections</strong> to manage pain. Surgery is typically reserved for curves exceeding 50 degrees or when nerve compression causes leg weakness."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the first symptoms of degenerative scoliosis?",
        answer: "Symptoms typically begin with <strong>gradual lower back pain</strong> and stiffness in the morning. As the curve progresses, patients may notice uneven shoulders, a rib hump, or shooting leg pain (<a href=\"/conditions/sciatica\">sciatica</a>) caused by the narrowing of the spinal canal."
      },
      {
        question: "Is spinal fusion the only option for scoliosis surgery?",
        answer: "While <a href=\"/treatments/spinal-fusion\">spinal fusion</a> is the most common method to permanently straighten the spine, <strong>decompression surgery</strong> (laminectomy) alone may be performed if the primary symptom is leg pain and the spinal curve is stable."
      },
      {
        question: "How long is the recovery for adult scoliosis surgery?",
        answer: "Recovery is significant, typically requiring <strong>3 to 6 months for fusion to solidify</strong>. Patients usually walk the day after surgery but must limit bending and twisting for several months to ensure the spine heals correctly."
      }
    ],
    "adjacent-segment-disease": [
      {
        question: "What is Adjacent Segment Disease (ASD)?",
        answer: "Adjacent Segment Disease is a condition where <strong>spinal levels immediately above or below a previous fusion degenerate</strong> due to increased mechanical stress. It is a potential long-term complication of spinal fusion surgery."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you prevent Adjacent Segment Disease?",
        answer: "The best prevention is maintaining a <strong>healthy weight and strong core muscles</strong> to support the spine. Additionally, opting for motion-preservation surgeries like <a href=\"/treatments/artificial-disc-replacement-surgery\">Artificial Disc Replacement</a> instead of fusion can significantly reduce the risk."
      },
      {
        question: "Does adjacent segment disease always require surgery?",
        answer: "No. Treatment begins with conservative measures like <strong>targeted exercises, bracing, and injections</strong>. Surgery is only recommended if these fail and nerve compression causes significant pain or weakness."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of adjacent segment disease?",
        answer: "Symptoms mimic the original spinal problem, including <strong>returning back pain or radiating leg pain</strong> (<a href=\"/conditions/sciatica\">sciatica</a>) years after a successful fusion surgery, indicating new degeneration at a neighboring level."
      },
      {
        question: "How is adjacent segment disease treated surgically?",
        answer: "Surgical treatment typically involves <strong>extending the fusion</strong> to include the affected level. In some cases, a <a href=\"/treatments/lumbar-decompression\">decompression</a> or disc replacement can be performed to address the new issue without further fusing the spine."
      }
    ],
    "lumbar-herniated-disc": [
      {
        question: "How does a lumbar herniated disc cause sciatica?",
        answer: "A herniated disc causes sciatica when the <strong>inner gel of the disc leaks out</strong> and chemically irritates or mechanically compresses the sciatic nerve roots. This sends shooting pain, numbness, or tingling down the leg."
      },
      {
        question: "Will a herniated disc heal on its own?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes, 80-90% of herniated discs resolve on their own</strong> within 6 to 12 weeks. The body naturally reabsorbs the herniated material, and inflammation subsides with rest and anti-inflammatory medication."
      },
      {
        question: "What activities should I avoid with a herniated disc?",
        answer: "Avoid <strong>heavy lifting, deep bending, and prolonged sitting</strong>, as these increase pressure on the discs. High-impact activities like running should also be paused until the disc heals."
      },
      {
        question: "When is surgery needed for a herniated disc?",
        answer: "Surgery (<a href=\"/treatments/lumbar-microdiscectomy-surgery\">Microdiscectomy</a>) is recommended if pain is <strong>unmanageable after 6-12 weeks</strong> of conservative care, or immediately if there is progressive muscle weakness (foot drop) or loss of bladder/bowel control."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the fastest way to relieve herniated disc pain?",
        answer: "The fastest relief often comes from <a href=\"/treatments/epidural-steroid-injection\">epidural steroid injections</a>, which deliver strong anti-inflammatories directly to the nerve root. For home care, alternating ice and heat with NSAIDs and gentle extension exercises (McKenzie method) is effective."
      }
    ],
    "degenerative-disc-disease": [
      {
        question: "Is Degenerative Disc Disease actually a disease?",
        answer: "No, it is not a disease but a <strong>natural condition of aging</strong>. It refers to the wear-and-tear of spinal discs that lose hydration and height over time, potentially leading to pain or instability."
      },
      {
        question: "Does Degenerative Disc Disease lead to paralysis?",
        answer: "<strong>Extremely rarely.</strong> DDD primarily causes chronic pain and stiffness. While it can lead to nerve compression causing weakness, it does not typically cause total paralysis."
      },
      {
        question: "What makes degenerative disc pain worse?",
        answer: "Pain is often aggravated by <strong>sitting for long periods, bending, or lifting</strong>, which increases intradiscal pressure. Walking or changing positions frequently usually helps relieve symptoms."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you reverse degenerative disc disease?",
        answer: "You cannot strictly 'reverse' the degeneration, as discs do not regenerate. However, <a href=\"/treatments/non-surgical-treatments-for-pain-management\">non-surgical treatments</a> can manage symptoms effectively, and lifestyle changes like weight loss can slow the progression."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best exercise for degenerative disc disease?",
        answer: "Low-impact aerobic exercises like <strong>walking, swimming, or cycling</strong> are best. They increase blood flow to the spine without high impact. Core strengthening (Pilates, yoga) helps support the spine and reduce load on the discs."
      }
    ],
    "cervical-spinal-stenosis": [
      {
        question: "What are the warning signs of cervical spinal stenosis?",
        answer: "Warning signs include <strong>neck pain, numbness in the hands</strong>, and balance coordination issues. Severe cases may cause 'myelopathy,' characterized by difficulty with fine motor skills like buttoning a shirt."
      },
      {
        question: "Can cervical stenosis be cured without surgery?",
        answer: "Stenosis is a structural narrowing that <strong>cannot be cured non-surgically</strong>, but symptoms can be managed. Targeted exercises and injections can relieve inflammation, but they do not widen the spinal canal."
      },
      {
        question: "How is cervical stenosis treated surgically?",
        answer: "Common surgeries include <a href=\"/treatments/acdf-surgery\">ACDF (Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion)</a> to remove the disc pressing on the cord, or Posterior Cervical Laminectomy to remove the back of the vertebra and create more space for the spinal cord."
      },
      {
        question: "Is walking difficult with cervical stenosis?",
        answer: "Yes, if the spinal cord is compressed (myelopathy), it can affect <strong>gait and balance</strong>, making patients feel unsteady or 'drunk' when walking, even if they have no leg pain."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if cervical stenosis is left untreated?",
        answer: "If untreated, severe cervical stenosis can lead to <strong>permanent nerve damage or paralysis</strong>. Progressive weakness and loss of hand function are signs that surgery should not be delayed."
      }
    ],
    "spondylolisthesis": [
      {
        question: "What is the difference between spondylosis and spondylolisthesis?",
        answer: "Spondylosis is general spinal arthritis. <strong>Spondylolisthesis is the slippage</strong> of one vertebra forward over the one below it. This slippage can cause instability and pinch nerves."
      },
      {
        question: "Is walking good for spondylolisthesis?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes, walking is beneficial.</strong> It strengthens the core and legs without placing heavy stress on the spine. However, avoid hyperextending (arching) the back, which can worsen the slip."
      },
      {
        question: "What grade of spondylolisthesis requires surgery?",
        answer: "Surgery is typically required for <strong>Grade 3 or 4 slips (over 50% slippage)</strong> or if lower grades cause intractable nerve pain. <a href=\"/treatments/spinal-fusion\">Spinal fusion</a> stabilizes the slipped vertebra."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a chiropractor fix spondylolisthesis?",
        answer: "Chiropractors can provide symptom relief for mild slips, but <strong>they cannot push the vertebra back into place</strong>. High-velocity adjustments should be avoided in unstable, high-grade slips."
      },
      {
        question: "What exercises should be avoided with spondylolisthesis?",
        answer: "Avoid exercises that involve <strong>extension (arching the back)</strong>, such as 'Superman' poses or heavy overhead lifting, as these can push the slipped vertebra further forward."
      }
    ],
    "cervical-herniated-disc": [
      {
        question: "Where do you feel pain from a cervical herniated disc?",
        answer: "Pain usually starts in the neck and radiates down the <strong>shoulder blade, arm, and into the fingers</strong>. The specific fingers affected depend on which nerve (C5, C6, C7) is compressed."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does a cervical herniated disc take to heal?",
        answer: "Most cases improve within <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong> with non-surgical care. If nerve pain is severe or causes weakness, surgery like <a href=\"/treatments/cervical-disc-replacement\">cervical disc replacement</a> may be discussed sooner."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a cervical herniated disc cause headaches?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes, cervicogenic headaches</strong> are common. They typically start at the base of the skull and radiate to the forehead or behind the eyes due to muscle tension and nerve irritation."
      },
      {
        question: "Is heat or ice better for a herniated neck disc?",
        answer: "Use <strong>ice for the first 48 hours</strong> to reduce inflammation. After that, heat can help relax the tight muscles and spasms that often accompany a herniated disc."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best pillow for a cervical herniated disc?",
        answer: "A <strong>cervical contour pillow</strong> that keeps the neck in a neutral position (aligned with the spine) is best. Avoid pillows that are too high, which flex the neck forward."
      }
    ],
    "spinal-compression-fractures": [
      {
        question: "How are spinal compression fractures treated in the elderly?",
        answer: "First-line treatment is pain management and bracing. For persistent pain, <a href=\"/treatments/fracture-fixation\">Kyphoplasty (Fracture Fixation)</a> is a minimally invasive procedure where bone cement is injected to stabilize the fracture and restore height."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the main cause of compression fractures?",
        answer: "<strong>Osteoporosis (weak bones)</strong> is the leading cause, allowing even minor movements like coughing or lifting to collapse a vertebra. Trauma is a secondary cause."
      },
      {
        question: "Is bed rest recommended for compression fractures?",
        answer: "<strong>Only briefly.</strong> Prolonged bed rest can worsen bone loss. Early mobilization with a back brace is encouraged to prevent complications like pneumonia or blood clots."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a compression fracture heal on its own?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes, the bone typically heals in 8-10 weeks.</strong> However, the vertebra often heals in a wedge shape, which can lead to a hunched posture (kyphosis) if not treated."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if I have a compression fracture?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>sudden, severe back pain</strong> (often after a minor fall or lifting), which worsens when standing or walking and improves when lying down."
      }
    ],
    "kyphosis": [
      {
        question: "Can bad posture cause permanent Kyphosis?",
        answer: "Postural kyphosis can typically be corrected with <strong>targeted exercises and habit changes</strong>. However, structural kyphosis (like Scheuermann's disease) involves misshapen bones and requires medical treatment."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the surgical treatment for severe Kyphosis?",
        answer: "Surgery involves <a href=\"/treatments/spinal-fusion\">spinal fusion</a> with instrumentation (rods and screws) to realign the spine. In rigid cases, an osteotomy (cutting the bone) helps correct the curvature."
      },
      {
        question: "Is a brace effective for adult kyphosis?",
        answer: "<strong>Generally no.</strong> Bracing is most effective for adolescents who are still growing. In adults, bracing may provide pain relief but will not permanently correct the spinal curve."
      },
      {
        question: "What causes a 'dowager's hump'?",
        answer: "A dowager's hump is usually caused by <strong>multiple compression fractures</strong> in the upper spine due to osteoporosis, leading to an excessive forward curvature."
      },
      {
        question: "Does kyphosis affect breathing?",
        answer: "Yes, severe kyphosis can compress the chest cavity, <strong>limiting lung capacity</strong> and making it difficult to take deep breaths. This is a key indication for surgery."
      }
    ],
    "osteoarthritis": [
      {
        question: "What is the difference between osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis?",
        answer: "<strong>Osteoarthritis is wear-and-tear</strong> of the cartilage, affecting specific joints asymmetrically. Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease attacking the joint lining, often affecting joints symmetrically."
      },
      {
        question: "Can you rebuild cartilage lost to osteoarthritis?",
        answer: "<strong>No, cartilage cannot typically be regrown</strong> once lost. Treatments focus on preserving remaining cartilage and managing pain through injections (hyaluronic acid) and therapy."
      },
      {
        question: "Is walking good for osteoarthritis?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes.</strong> While it may seem counterintuitive, low-impact walking keeps joints lubricated and strengthens the muscles that support them, reducing overall pain."
      },
      {
        question: "When should I consider joint replacement for osteoarthritis?",
        answer: "Joint replacement, such as <a href=\"/treatments/total-hip-replacement\">total hip replacement</a>, is recommended when <strong>pain interferes with daily life</strong> (sleep, walking) and conservative treatments like injections and therapy no longer provide relief."
      },
      {
        question: "Does weather really affect arthritis pain?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes.</strong> Drops in barometric pressure can cause tissues in the joints to expand slightly, irritating nerve endings and increasing pain in arthritic joints."
      }
    ],
    "rotator-cuff-tear": [
      {
        question: "Can a rotator cuff tear heal without surgery?",
        answer: "<strong>Partial tears can heal</strong> or become asymptomatic with PT and regenerative injections. <strong>Full-thickness tears do not heal</strong> on their own and typically require surgical repair to restore strength."
      },
      {
        question: "What does a torn rotator cuff feel like?",
        answer: "It feels like a <strong>deep ache in the shoulder</strong>, especially at night. Patients often have difficulty raising their arm overhead or reaching behind their back."
      },
      {
        question: "How long is recovery after rotator cuff surgery?",
        answer: "Full recovery takes <strong>4 to 6 months</strong>. Patients wear a sling for 4-6 weeks, followed by passive motion therapy, and finally strengthening exercises."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I lift weights with a rotator cuff tear?",
        answer: "You should avoid <strong>overhead pressing and heavy lifting</strong> until cleared by a doctor. Strengthening the surrounding scapular muscles is beneficial, but heavy loads can widen the tear."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the success rate of rotator cuff repair?",
        answer: "Success rates are high, generally <strong>over 90% for pain relief</strong>. Functional strength return depends on the size of the tear and the patient's adherence to rehabilitation. See more about <a href=\"/treatments/rotator-cuff-repair-surgery\">rotator cuff repair surgery</a>."
      }
    ],
    "acl-injury": [
      {
        question: "Do all ACL tears require surgery?",
        answer: "<strong>No.</strong> Sedentary patients or those with partial tears may recover with bracing and PT. However, athletes and active individuals usually need <a href=\"/treatments/acl-reconstruction-surgery\">ACL reconstruction</a> to restore stability."
      },
      {
        question: "How long after ACL injury can I walk?",
        answer: "Most patients can walk <strong>within a few weeks</strong> after injury or surgery, often with crutches initially. Full normal gait typically returns by 4-6 weeks post-op."
      },
      {
        question: "Can an ACL tear heal itself?",
        answer: "<strong>Generally, no.</strong> The ACL has poor blood supply and is submerged in joint fluid, which prevents a full tear from knitting back together naturally."
      },
      {
        question: "What graft is best for ACL reconstruction?",
        answer: "Common grafts include the <strong>patellar tendon, hamstring tendon, or donor tissue (allograft)</strong>. The 'best' choice depends on the patient's age, activity level, and surgeon preference."
      },
      {
        question: "When can I return to sports after ACL surgery?",
        answer: "Return to sports typically takes <strong>6 to 9 months</strong>. It requires not just time, but passing functional tests to ensure the leg is strong enough to prevent re-injury."
      }
    ],
    "labral-tears": [
      {
        question: "What does a hip labral tear feel like?",
        answer: "A hip labral tear causes <strong>sharp groin pain</strong>, often accompanied by a clicking, locking, or catching sensation deep in the hip joint."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a labral tear be missed on MRI?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes.</strong> A standard MRI can miss small tears. An <strong>MRA (MRI with contrast dye)</strong> is the gold standard for diagnosing labral tears in the hip or shoulder."
      },
      {
        question: "Do hip labral tears require surgery?",
        answer: "Not always. Many are managed with <strong>targeted exercises, bracing, and injections</strong>. Surgery (<a href=\"/treatments/hip-arthroscopy-treatment\">hip arthroscopy</a>) is considered if pain persists and mechanical symptoms (locking) interfere with daily life."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between a SLAP tear and a Bankart tear?",
        answer: "Both are shoulder labral tears. A <strong>SLAP tear</strong> is at the top (biceps attachment), while a <strong>Bankart tear</strong> is at the bottom (usually from dislocation) and causes instability."
      },
      {
        question: "How long is recovery from labral repair surgery?",
        answer: "Recovery takes <strong>4 to 6 months</strong>. The first month involves protecting the repair (crutches or sling), followed by progressive range of motion and strengthening."

    ],
    "torn-meniscus": [
      {
        question: "Can you walk on a torn meniscus?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes, often.</strong> Many people can walk on a minor tear, though it may be painful. If the knee locks or buckles, walking becomes dangerous and surgery may be needed."
      },
      {
        question: "Does a meniscus tear heal without surgery?",
        answer: "Tears in the <strong>outer 'red zone' (good blood supply)</strong> can heal on their own. Tears in the inner 'white zone' lack blood flow and usually require surgical trimming."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the difference between repair and removal?",
        answer: "<strong>Repair</strong> stitches the meniscus (longer recovery, better long-term joint health). <strong>Meniscectomy</strong> trims the damaged part (faster recovery, higher arthritis risk). Learn more about <a href=\"/treatments/meniscus-repair-surgery\">meniscus repair surgery</a>."
      },
      {
        question: "How do I know if my meniscus tear is severe?",
        answer: "Severe tears often cause <strong>mechanical symptoms</strong> like the knee locking in place (inability to straighten) or giving way, along with significant swelling."
      },
      {
        question: "Is cycling good for a torn meniscus?",
        answer: "<strong>Yes.</strong> Cycling is excellent as it strengthens the legs with low impact. Ensure the seat is high enough to avoid deep knee bending."

      {
        question: "Where is SI joint pain located?",
        answer: "SI joint pain is felt in the <strong>lower back and buttocks</strong>, often radiating into the groin or upper thigh. It is frequently mistaken for a herniated disc."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you fix SI joint pain?",
        answer: "Treatments include <strong>SI joint belts, targeted stabilization exercises, and steroid injections</strong>. If these fail, minimally invasive SI joint fusion uses titanium implants to stabilize the joint."
      },
      {
        question: "What aggravates SI joint pain?",
        answer: "Pain is often worse with <strong>transitional movements</strong> (standing up from a chair), climbing stairs, or standing on one leg."
      },
      {
        question: "How is SI joint dysfunction diagnosed?",
        answer: "It is diagnosed via physical provocation tests and confirmed with a <strong>diagnostic injection</strong>. If the injection relieves pain temporarily, the SI joint is the confirmed source."
      },
      {
        question: "Is SI joint fusion major surgery?",
        answer: "No, modern <strong>minimally invasive SI fusion</strong> is performed through a small incision, takes less than an hour, and has a rapid recovery time compared to traditional open surgery."

    "trochanteric-bursitis": [
      {
        question: "What triggers trochanteric bursitis?",
        answer: "Triggers include <strong>repetitive friction</strong> (walking/running), direct trauma (falling on the hip), or gait abnormalities caused by other issues like arthritis or leg length discrepancy."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does hip bursitis take to heal?",
        answer: "With rest and treatment, it typically resolves in <strong>6 to 8 weeks</strong>. Chronic cases may require targeted exercises or <a href=\"/treatments/anti-inflammatory-injections-for-joint-and-spine-pain\">cortisone injections</a> to break the cycle of inflammation."
      },
      {
        question: "Is walking good for hip bursitis?",
        answer: "Walking is okay in moderation, but <strong>excessive walking can aggravate the bursa</strong>. It is best to rest until acute pain subsides, then gradually reintroduce activity."
      },
      {
        question: "How do you sleep with trochanteric bursitis?",
        answer: "Sleep on the <strong>unaffected side</strong> with a pillow between your knees. This aligns the hips and reduces pressure on the inflamed bursa."
      },
      {
        question: "Does bursitis ever require surgery?",
        answer: "<strong>Rarely.</strong> Surgery (bursectomy) is only considered if months of non-surgical treatment, including injections and therapy, fail to provide relief."

      },
      {
        question: "Can carpal tunnel go away on its own?",
        answer: "Mild cases can resolve with <strong>rest and wrist splinting</strong>. However, if the nerve compression is structural, it typically progresses without treatment."
      },
      {
        question: "Is surgery the only fix for carpal tunnel?",
        answer: "No. <strong>Splinting, ergonomic changes, and steroid injections</strong> are effective early treatments. <a href=\"/treatments/carpal-tunnel-release\">Carpal tunnel release</a> is needed when nerve damage risk is high."
      },
      {
        question: "How long is recovery from carpal tunnel release?",
        answer: "The skin heals in 2 weeks. <strong>Grip strength returns over 2-3 months.</strong> Most patients report immediate relief from the nighttime numbness."
      },
      {
        question: "What happens if carpal tunnel is left untreated?",

      {
        question: "Is a SLAP tear the same as a rotator cuff tear?",
        answer: "No, they are different structures. A SLAP tear affects the labrum (cartilage rim around the socket), while a rotator cuff tear affects the tendons that move the shoulder. However, both conditions can coexist and may cause similar symptoms."
      },
      {
        question: "Will a SLAP tear heal on its own?",
        answer: "Some SLAP tears improve with rehab and activity modification, but the labral cartilage itself doesn't regenerate. Symptoms can resolve as inflammation decreases and surrounding muscles compensate, even if the tear remains on imaging."
      },
      {
        question: "Does MRI always show a SLAP tear?",
        answer: "Not always. Standard MRI can miss subtle tears. MRI arthrogram (with contrast injected into the joint) is more sensitive. However, correlation with clinical exam is key—labral irregularities can appear on MRI in people without pain."

        question: "When is surgery necessary for a SLAP tear?",
        answer: "Surgery is considered when there is persistent pain or instability after 6-12 weeks of structured rehab, in high-demand athletes who need overhead function, or when mechanical symptoms (catching, locking) significantly limit activities."
      },
      {
        question: "How long is recovery from SLAP tear treatment?",
        answer: "Non-surgical recovery often takes 6–12 weeks. Surgical recovery is longer—typically 4-6 months for full return to overhead sports or activities, depending on the repair type and activity demands."

    "shoulder-dislocation": [
      {
        question: "How do I know if my shoulder dislocated or just 'popped'?",
        answer: "A true dislocation causes severe pain, visible deformity (the shoulder looks 'out of place'), and complete loss of motion. It requires medical reduction. A 'pop' from subluxation (partial dislocation) is less severe but still needs evaluation if it happens repeatedly."
      },
      {
        question: "Will my shoulder dislocate again after the first time?",
        answer: "Risk depends on age, activity level, and bone/soft tissue damage. Young athletes (under 25) have up to 80% recurrence risk. Older patients have lower risk but higher chance of rotator cuff injury. Bone loss increases instability risk significantly."
      },
      {
        question: "Do I need surgery after my first shoulder dislocation?",
        answer: "Not always. Treatment depends on your age, activity demands, and injury details. High-risk groups (young athletes, significant bone loss, contact sports) may benefit from early surgery to prevent recurrence. Others can try rehab first."
      },
      {
        question: "How long do I wear a sling after shoulder dislocation?",
        answer: "Typically 1-3 weeks, but varies by age and injury severity. Prolonged immobilization (more than 3-4 weeks) increases stiffness risk. Your specialist will guide you on when to start gentle motion exercises."
      },
      {
        question: "What are signs of nerve injury from shoulder dislocation?",
        answer: "Numbness in the 'shoulder patch' area (outer upper arm), tingling down the arm, or hand weakness can indicate axillary nerve injury. This requires prompt evaluation but often improves with time. Persistent numbness beyond 6 weeks needs follow-up imaging."

    "ac-joint-injury": [
      {
        question: "Is an AC joint injury the same as a shoulder dislocation?",
        answer: "No, they are different injuries. AC joint injury (shoulder separation) affects where the collarbone meets the shoulder blade. Shoulder dislocation occurs when the ball of the upper arm comes out of the shoulder socket. They require different treatments."
      },
      {
        question: "Will the bump on my shoulder go away after AC joint injury?",
        answer: "In higher-grade injuries (Type 3-6), a permanent bump may remain even after symptoms resolve. This cosmetic change doesn't always correlate with function—many people return to full activity despite the visible deformity."
      },
      {
        question: "Do all AC joint separations need surgery?",
        answer: "Most do not. Grades 1-2 (sprains) almost always heal with conservative care. Grade 3 is controversial—often treated non-surgically first. Grades 4-6 or Grade 3 in overhead athletes may require surgery for optimal function."
      },
      {
        question: "When can I return to sports after AC joint injury?",
        answer: "Timeline depends on grade and sport. Low-grade injuries may allow return in 2-4 weeks with proper protection. Higher grades or surgical cases typically need 3-6 months. Contact sports require full strength and pain-free range of motion before clearance."
      },
      {
        question: "Can AC joint arthritis develop later after injury?",
        answer: "Yes, post-traumatic AC joint arthritis can occur years after injury, causing localized pain and tenderness at the top of the shoulder. It's treatable with activity modification, injections, or in severe cases, distal clavicle excision surgery."

        answer: "Effective non-surgical options include <strong>physical therapy for quadriceps strengthening</strong>, NSAIDs for inflammation, cortisone or hyaluronic acid injections, bracing for stability, and weight loss to reduce joint stress. Low-impact exercises like swimming preserve mobility without accelerating degeneration."
      },
      {
        question: "When is knee replacement surgery recommended for arthritis?",
        answer: "Surgery is considered when conservative treatments fail and <strong>arthritis significantly limits daily activities</strong> like walking, climbing stairs, or sleeping.

    "pcl-tear": [
      {
        question: "What is a PCL tear and how does it happen?",
        answer: "A <strong>posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) tear</strong> occurs when the ligament stabilizing the back of the knee is damaged. It typically results from direct trauma to the front of the tibia (dashboard injury in car accidents) or hyperextension, less commonly from sports."
      },
      {
        question: "Can a PCL tear heal without surgery?",
        answer: "Yes, many isolated PCL tears heal with <strong>non-surgical treatment</strong> because the PCL has better blood supply than the ACL. Conservative management includes bracing, physical therapy emphasizing quadriceps strengthening, and activity modification. Surgery is reserved for grade III tears or combined ligament injuries."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of a torn PCL?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>mild to moderate knee swelling</strong>, instability when descending stairs or walking downhill, pain in the back of the knee, and difficulty kneeling. Unlike ACL tears, patients often retain the ability to walk immediately after injury."
      },
      {
        question: "How is a PCL tear diagnosed?",
        answer: "Diagnosis involves the <strong>posterior drawer test</strong> where the doctor pushes the tibia backward to assess instability. MRI confirms the tear location and severity. X-rays rule out associated fractures, particularly at the tibial insertion point."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the recovery time for a PCL tear?",
        answer: "Non-surgical recovery typically takes <strong>3 to 4 months</strong> with dedicated rehabilitation. Surgical reconstruction requires 6-9 months for full recovery, including graft healing and return to sports. Early rehabilitation focuses on preventing posterior tibial sag and strengthening the quadriceps."

    "knee-cartilage-damage": [
      {
        question: "What causes knee cartilage damage?",
        answer: "<strong>Knee cartilage damage</strong> results from acute trauma (sports injuries, falls), degenerative wear from arthritis, or repetitive stress. Meniscus tears and articular cartilage defects are the two primary types, each requiring different treatment approaches."
      },
      {
        question: "Can damaged knee cartilage repair itself?",
        answer: "Meniscus cartilage has limited healing capacity in its outer third due to <strong>minimal blood supply</strong>. Articular (joint surface) cartilage cannot regenerate naturally. Treatment options include repair techniques for meniscus tears or <a href=\"/treatments/knee-cartilage-restoration\">cartilage restoration procedures</a> for articular defects."

      {
        question: "What are symptoms of knee cartilage damage?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>sharp pain with twisting or pivoting</strong>, swelling after activity, catching or locking sensations, and stiffness. Articular cartilage damage causes grinding (crepitus) and pain with weight-bearing, while meniscus tears cause mechanical symptoms."
      },
      {
        question: "How is knee cartilage damage diagnosed?",
        answer: "MRI is the gold standard for detecting <strong>cartilage tears and defects</strong>.

    "knee-instability": [
      {
        question: "What causes knee instability?",
        answer: "<strong>Knee instability</strong> results from ligament tears (ACL, PCL, MCL, LCL), meniscus damage, or muscle weakness. The knee gives way or buckles during activities, particularly with cutting, pivoting, or going down stairs. Multiple ligament injuries cause severe instability."
      },
      {
        question: "Can knee instability be fixed without surgery?",
        answer: "Mild instability from <strong>partial ligament tears</strong> may respond to physical therapy focusing on quadriceps and hamstring strengthening, along with bracing for support. However, complete ACL tears or multi-ligament injuries typically require surgical reconstruction to restore stability for active lifestyles."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of an unstable knee?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>a sensation of the knee giving way</strong>, difficulty with directional changes in sports, swelling after activity, and reluctance to trust the knee. Chronic instability can lead to secondary meniscus tears and early arthritis development."
      },
      {
        question: "How is knee instability diagnosed?",
        answer: "Physical examination tests like the <strong>Lachman test, pivot shift, and drawer tests</strong> assess ligament integrity. MRI reveals ligament tears, meniscus damage, and bone bruises. Stress X-rays quantify the degree of instability in multiple planes."

        question: "What are the symptoms of knee bursitis?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>localized swelling and tenderness</strong> over the affected bursa, pain with direct pressure (kneeling), warmth, and redness if infected. Unlike arthritis, knee bursitis doesn't typically cause pain with weight-bearing or walking."
      },
      {
        question: "How is knee bursitis treated?",
        answer: "Treatment begins with <strong>rest, ice, and compression</strong>, along with NSAIDs for inflammation. Avoiding aggravating activities (kneeling) is crucial. Aspiration may drain excess fluid, and corticosteroid injections reduce inflammation. Infected bursitis requires antibiotics and surgical drainage."
      },
      {
        question: "Can knee bursitis become chronic?",
        answer: "Yes, repeated trauma or inadequate treatment can lead to <strong>chronic bursitis</strong> with thickened bursal walls and recurrent swelling. Chronic cases may require bursa removal (bursectomy) if conservative treatments fail. Proper padding and activity modification prevent recurrence."
      },
      {
        question: "How long does knee bursitis take to heal?",
        answer: "<strong>Acute bursitis typically resolves in 2 to 4 weeks</strong> with rest and anti-inflammatory treatment. Chronic or septic bursitis may take months. Return to kneeling activities should wait until pain-free and swelling has completely resolved to prevent flare-ups."

        question: "What causes runner's knee pain?",
        answer: "PFPS develops from <strong>quadriceps muscle weakness</strong> (especially VMO), tight IT bands or hamstrings, hip abductor weakness, overpronation, or sudden increases in training intensity. Poor patellar tracking increases pressure on cartilage, causing pain."
      },
      {
        question: "How is patellofemoral pain syndrome treated?",
        answer: "Treatment focuses on <strong>physical therapy to strengthen the VMO</strong> and hip abductors, stretching tight structures, patellar taping or bracing, activity modification, and correcting biomechanics with orthotics. Ice and NSAIDs manage symptoms. Surgery is rarely needed."
      },
      {
        question: "Can I continue running with runner's knee?",
        answer: "Running should be reduced or modified while healing. <strong>Cross-training with swimming or cycling</strong> maintains fitness without aggravating symptoms. Gradually return to running once pain-free, ensuring proper form, appropriate footwear, and adequate hip/quad strength."

      },
      {
        question: "What's the difference between chondromalacia and patellofemoral pain?",
        answer: "Chondromalacia refers to <strong>actual cartilage damage</strong> visible on MRI or arthroscopy, while patellofemoral pain syndrome describes the pain pattern without proven structural damage. Untreated PFPS can progress to chondromalacia if biomechanical issues persist."
      },
      {
        question: "Can chondromalacia patella be reversed?",
        answer: "Early-stage cartilage softening may improve with <strong>aggressive physical therapy</strong> and activity modification, but advanced damage is irreversible. Treatment aims to prevent progression through proper patellar tracking, strengthening weak muscles (VMO, hip abductors), and reducing compressive forces."

      {
        question: "What is lumbar stenosis?",
        answer: "<strong>Lumbar stenosis</strong> is narrowing of the spinal canal in the lower back, compressing nerves. It typically results from age-related degeneration, bone spurs, thickened ligaments, or disc bulging. Symptoms worsen with standing/walking and improve with sitting/bending forward."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of lumbar stenosis?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>leg pain, numbness, or weakness</strong> worsening with walking (neurogenic claudication), lower back pain, cramping in the legs, and difficulty walking long distances. Sitting or leaning forward (shopping cart sign) provides relief."
      },
      {
        question: "Can lumbar stenosis be treated without surgery?",
        answer: "Yes, many patients improve with <strong>physical therapy, epidural steroid injections</strong>, activity modification, assistive devices (cane), and pain management. Weight loss reduces spinal stress. Surgery is considered when conservative care fails and symptoms limit quality of life."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best treatment for lumbar stenosis?",
        answer: "Treatment depends on severity. <strong>Epidural injections</strong> provide temporary relief. Physical therapy strengthens core and improves flexibility. When symptoms significantly limit walking/daily activities despite conservative care, <a href=\"/treatments/lumbar-laminectomy-surgery\">decompression surgery</a> (laminectomy) relieves pressure on nerves."
      },
      {
        question: "How is lumbar stenosis diagnosed?",
        answer: "Diagnosis combines clinical history of <strong>positional symptoms</strong> with imaging. MRI is the gold standard, showing canal narrowing and nerve compression. CT myelography is an alternative if MRI is contraindicated. X-rays assess alignment and bone spurs."

      {
        question: "How long does whiplash take to heal?",
        answer: "Mild whiplash typically improves in <strong>2-4 weeks</strong> with conservative care. Moderate cases may take 2-3 months. Chronic whiplash persisting beyond 6 months occurs in 10-20% of patients and may require more intensive treatment."
      },
      {
        question: "What is the best treatment for whiplash?",
        answer: "Early treatment includes <strong>gentle activity as tolerated</strong> rather than rigid collar immobilization, ice/heat therapy, NSAIDs, and physical therapy focusing on range of motion and strengthening. Muscle relaxants may help acute spasms. Avoid prolonged immobilization."
      },
      {
        question: "Can whiplash cause long-term problems?",
        answer: "Most recover fully, but some develop <strong>chronic pain, headaches, or cognitive issues</strong>. Risk factors for chronic symptoms include severe initial pain, older age, pre-existing neck problems, and rapid onset of symptoms. Early active treatment improves outcomes."

    "chronic-pain": [
      {
        question: "What is chronic pain?",
        answer: "<strong>Chronic pain</strong> is pain lasting beyond 3-6 months, persisting after tissue healing. It involves neurological changes where pain signals become amplified. Common sources include arthritis, nerve damage, spine conditions, or complex regional pain syndrome."
      },
      {
        question: "What causes chronic pain to persist?",
        answer: "Chronic pain involves <strong>central sensitization</strong> where the nervous system becomes hypersensitive. Contributing factors include tissue damage, inflammation, nerve injury, psychological factors (stress, depression), and altered pain processing in the brain and spinal cord."
      },
      {
        question: "Can chronic pain be cured?",
        answer: "While complete cure may not be possible, chronic pain can be <strong>effectively managed</strong> through multimodal approaches including physical therapy, medications, injections, psychological support, lifestyle modifications, and sometimes surgical interventions addressing underlying structural problems."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the best treatments for chronic pain?",
        answer: "Effective management combines <strong>physical therapy, graded exercise programs</strong>, medications (NSAIDs, neuropathic pain drugs, occasional opioids), interventional procedures (nerve blocks, spinal cord stimulation), cognitive behavioral therapy, and addressing sleep and mental health."
      },
      {
        question: "How does physical therapy help chronic pain?",
        answer: "<strong>Physical therapy</strong> breaks the pain-inactivity cycle through graded exercise, improving strength and flexibility, reducing fear-avoidance behaviors, and restoring function. It modulates pain signals through movement and helps patients regain confidence in their bodies."

    "nerve-pain": [
      {
        question: "What is nerve pain (neuropathic pain)?",
        answer: "<strong>Nerve pain</strong> (neuropathic pain) results from nerve damage or dysfunction causing burning, shooting, or electric-shock sensations. Common causes include pinched nerves, diabetic neuropathy, post-herpetic neuralgia, and nerve injuries."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of nerve pain?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>burning, shooting, or stabbing pain</strong>, electric-shock sensations, numbness or tingling, sensitivity to touch (allodynia), and pain at night. Pain may be constant or intermittent and doesn't always respond to traditional pain medications."
      },
      {
        question: "How is nerve pain different from other pain?",
        answer: "<strong>Nerve pain</strong> stems from the nervous system itself rather than tissue damage. It causes atypical sensations (burning, electric), may occur without clear injury, and responds better to neuropathic medications (gabapentin, duloxetine) than NSAIDs or opioids."
      },
      {
        question: "What medications treat nerve pain?",
        answer: "First-line medications include <strong>gabapentin, pregabalin (Lyrica), and duloxetine (Cymbalta)</strong>. Tricyclic antidepressants (amitriptyline) are also effective. Topical lidocaine patches help localized pain. Traditional painkillers like NSAIDs are less effective for neuropathic pain."
      },
      {
        question: "Can nerve pain be cured?",
        answer: "Cure depends on the underlying cause. <strong>Compressive neuropathies</strong> (pinched nerves) often improve with surgical decompression. Diabetic neuropathy requires glucose control. Some nerve pain becomes chronic, requiring ongoing management with medications and supportive therapies."

    "radiculopathy": [
      {
        question: "What is radiculopathy?",
        answer: "<strong>Radiculopathy</strong> is nerve root compression in the spine causing pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness radiating into an arm or leg. Cervical radiculopathy affects arms; lumbar radiculopathy causes leg symptoms. Common causes include herniated discs and bone spurs."
      },
      {
        question: "What are the symptoms of radiculopathy?",
        answer: "Symptoms include <strong>sharp, shooting pain</strong> following a nerve distribution (dermatomal pattern), numbness, tingling, weakness in specific muscle groups, and reflex changes. Neck movements worsen cervical radiculopathy; bending/coughing exacerbates lumbar radiculopathy."
      },
      {
        question: "Can radiculopathy heal without surgery?",
        answer: "Yes, <strong>80-90% of radiculopathy cases improve</strong> with conservative treatment including rest, physical therapy, anti-inflammatory medications, and epidural steroid injections. Symptoms often resolve as disc herniations shrink and inflammation subsides over 6-12 weeks."
      },
      {
        question: "When is surgery needed for radiculopathy?",
        answer: "Surgery is indicated for <strong>progressive weakness (foot drop, hand weakness)</strong>, bowel/bladder dysfunction (emergency), or persistent pain unresponsive to 6-12 weeks of conservative care. Options include <a href=\"/treatments/lumbar-microdiscectomy-surgery\">microdiscectomy</a> or foraminotomy."
      },
      {
        question: "How is radiculopathy diagnosed?",
        answer: "<strong>MRI</strong> is the gold standard showing disc herniations, stenosis, or bone spurs compressing nerve roots. Physical examination reveals specific nerve root involvement through dermatomal patterns, reflex changes, and weakness. EMG/nerve conduction studies confirm nerve damage."
