  // 1. Revision Spinal Surgery
  "revision-spinal-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of revision spinal surgery?",
      answer: "The <strong>success rate of revision spinal surgery</strong> varies by condition but generally ranges between <strong>60% and 80%</strong> for pain relief. While lower than primary surgery due to scar tissue and anatomical changes, modern techniques like computer-navigated placement of <strong>pedicle screws</strong> have significantly improved outcomes for correcting <strong>pseudoarthrosis</strong> (failed fusion) and adjacent segment disease."
    },
    {
      question: "Is revision spine surgery more painful than the first?",
      answer: "Yes, <strong>revision spine surgery</strong> is often more painful initially than the first procedure because it involves working through scar tissue and often requires more extensive reconstruction. However, specialized <strong>pain management protocols</strong> are used to ensure patient comfort, and the long-term relief from nerve compression typically outweighs the surgical recovery period."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the recovery for revision spinal surgery?",
      answer: "Recovery is typically longer than the initial surgery, often requiring <strong>3 to 5 days in the hospital</strong> and <strong>3 to 6 months</strong> for bone fusion to solidify. Patients may need to wear a back brace for support during the first 6 to 12 weeks while avoiding bending, lifting, and twisting."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of revision spine surgery?",
      answer: "Risks include a higher rate of infection, dural tears (spinal fluid leak), and nerve injury compared to primary surgery. Utilizing a specialized <strong>orthopedic spine surgeon</strong> who uses intraoperative neuromonitoring drastically reduces these risks."
    }
  ],

  // 2. Multilevel Degenerative Disc Disease Surgery
  "multilevel-degenerative-disc-disease-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Can surgery fix multilevel degenerative disc disease?",
      answer: "Yes, surgery is effective for <strong>multilevel degenerative disc disease</strong> when conservative care fails. Options include <strong>multilevel spinal fusion</strong> to stabilize the spine or <strong>hybrid surgery</strong> (combining fusion and disc replacement) to preserve motion while correcting instability across multiple spinal segments."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the recovery for 3-level spinal fusion?",
      answer: "Recovery from a <strong>3-level spinal fusion</strong> is a major process, typically requiring <strong>6 to 12 months</strong> for complete bone healing. Patients usually walk the day after surgery but must strictly limit physical activity for the first 3 months to ensure the grafts fuse properly."
    },
    {
      question: "Does multilevel fusion limit mobility?",
      answer: "Yes, fusing multiple levels of the spine will reduce flexibility in that specific region. However, most patients find that the elimination of debilitating pain allows for better overall functional mobility than they had prior to surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "Is multilevel disc replacement an option?",
      answer: "For qualified patients with healthy facet joints, <strong>multilevel artificial disc replacement</strong> (up to 2 levels) can be performed to maintain neck or back motion. This reduces the risk of adjacent segment disease compared to long fusion constructs."
    }
  ],

  // 3. Anterior Lumbar Corpectomy and Fusion
  "anterior-lumbar-corpectomy-and-fusion": [
    {
      question: "What happens during an Anterior Lumbar Corpectomy?",
      answer: "During an <strong>Anterior Lumbar Corpectomy</strong>, the surgeon removes the entire vertebral body and the adjacent discs to decompress the spinal cord. A <strong>vertebral body replacement (VBR) cage</strong> filled with bone graft is inserted to reconstruct the spine and promote <strong>spinal fusion</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "Is a corpectomy a major surgery?",
      answer: "Yes, a <strong>corpectomy</strong> is a major, complex spinal surgery used for severe trauma, tumors, or infection. Despite its complexity, the anterior approach (from the front) allows for direct decompression of the nerves without moving the sensitive spinal cord."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for a lumbar corpectomy?",
      answer: "Patients typically remain in the hospital for <strong>3 to 5 days</strong>. A custom back brace is worn for <strong>6 to 12 weeks</strong>, and full recovery with solid bone fusion generally takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong> depending on the patient's bone quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you walk after corpectomy surgery?",
      answer: "Yes, patients are encouraged to walk as soon as possible, often the day after surgery, to prevent blood clots and pneumonia. Walking is the primary form of exercise during the initial 6-week recovery phase."
    }
  ],

  // 4. Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion
  "anterior-lumbar-interbody-fusion": [
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of ALIF over posterior fusion?",
      answer: "<strong>ALIF (Anterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion)</strong> allows for the placement of a larger interbody cage, which provides better correction of spinal alignment (lordosis) and a larger surface area for fusion. It also avoids cutting through the large back muscles, leading to less post-operative pain."
    },
    {
      question: "Does ALIF surgery require a vascular surgeon?",
      answer: "Yes, an <strong>access surgeon</strong> (vascular surgeon) typically assists during <strong>ALIF surgery</strong> to safely move the major blood vessels (aorta and vena cava) aside, ensuring clear access to the front of the spine."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to recover from ALIF surgery?",
      answer: "Most patients go home within <strong>1 to 2 days</strong>. While bone fusion takes months, many patients return to light desk work in <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> and more active pursuits by <strong>3 months</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the permanent restrictions after ALIF?",
      answer: "Once the fusion is solid (usually after 1 year), there are rarely permanent restrictions. However, patients are often advised to use proper lifting mechanics and avoid extreme heavy loading of the spine to protect adjacent levels."
    }
  ],

  // 5. Hybrid Lumbar Spine Surgery
  "hybrid-lumbar-spine-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is hybrid lumbar spine surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Hybrid lumbar spine surgery</strong> combines two techniques: <strong>artificial disc replacement</strong> at one level (to preserve motion) and <strong>spinal fusion</strong> at an adjacent level (to stabilize severe degeneration). This offers a balanced approach for multilevel disease."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for hybrid spine surgery?",
      answer: "Ideal candidates have disease at multiple levels where one level is too degenerated for replacement (requiring fusion) but the adjacent level is healthy enough for an artificial disc. This minimizes the stiffness associated with multi-level fusion."
    },
    {
      question: "Is hybrid surgery recovery faster than fusion?",
      answer: "Recovery is generally similar to fusion because bone healing is still required at the fused level. However, patients often report better long-term function and flexibility compared to an all-fusion approach."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of hybrid spine surgery?",
      answer: "Risks are similar to standard spine surgery, including infection and implant migration. There is also a small risk that the artificial disc level may eventually degenerate and require conversion to a fusion."
    }
  ],

  // 6. Lumbar Fusion Surgery
  "lumbar-fusion-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of lumbar fusion surgery?",
      answer: "The <strong>success rate for lumbar fusion</strong> in treating spondylolisthesis and instability is high, typically <strong>85-95%</strong>. Success for treating solely 'back pain' without instability is variable, emphasizing the need for proper patient selection and diagnosis."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does back pain last after fusion surgery?",
      answer: "Acute surgical pain diminishes significantly within <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong>. However, patients may experience intermittent muscular soreness for <strong>3 to 6 months</strong> as they rehabilitate and the fusion solidifies."
    },
    {
      question: "Can screws come loose after lumbar fusion?",
      answer: "Yes, screw loosening can occur if the bone fails to fuse (<strong>pseudoarthrosis</strong>). This risk is higher in smokers and patients with osteoporosis. Following post-op restrictions and using bone growth stimulators helps prevent this."
    },
    {
      question: "When can I drive after lumbar fusion?",
      answer: "Most patients can return to driving <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> after surgery, provided they are off narcotic pain medication and can safely operate the vehicle without severe pain."
    }
  ],

  // 7. Spinal Fusion
  "spinal-fusion": [
    {
      question: "What are the permanent restrictions after spinal fusion?",
      answer: "For a single-level fusion, there are few <strong>permanent restrictions</strong>. For multi-level fusions, doctors typically advise avoiding <strong>heavy deadlifts</strong>, high-impact contact sports, and extreme spinal twisting to prevent adjacent segment disease."
    },
    {
      question: "How serious is spinal fusion surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Spinal fusion</strong> is a major orthopedic procedure. While safe and common, it involves a recovery period of several months. It is reserved for cases where instability, deformity, or severe nerve compression cannot be treated non-surgically."
    },
    {
      question: "Does spinal fusion stop you from bending?",
      answer: "A single-level fusion limits motion only at that specific segment, which is barely noticeable. Even with multi-level fusions, patients can still bend at the hips (hip-hinge) to pick things up, maintaining good functional mobility."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'dark side' of spinal fusion?",
      answer: "The 'dark side' refers to <strong>Adjacent Segment Disease</strong>, where the discs above and below the fusion wear out faster due to increased stress. This can occur years later, potentially requiring additional surgery. Minimally invasive techniques aim to reduce this risk."
    }
  ],

  // 8. Understanding TLIF Surgery
  "understanding-tlif-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What does TLIF stand for in spine surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>TLIF</strong> stands for <strong>Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion</strong>. It is a technique where the surgeon accesses the disc space from the back (posterior) but comes in from the side, minimizing the need to retract the spinal nerves."
    },
    {
      question: "Is TLIF surgery minimally invasive?",
      answer: "Yes, <strong>MIS-TLIF (Minimally Invasive TLIF)</strong> uses tubular retractors and small incisions. This results in less blood loss, less muscle damage, and a shorter hospital stay (often 1-2 days) compared to open surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take for a TLIF cage to fuse?",
      answer: "While the titanium or PEEK cage provides immediate stability, the actual <strong>bone fusion</strong> takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong> to fully mature. X-rays at follow-up appointments will track this progress."
    },
    {
      question: "Is TLIF safer than PLIF?",
      answer: "Generally, <strong>TLIF</strong> is considered safer for the nerves than PLIF (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion) because it requires less retraction of the thecal sac to place the cage, reducing the risk of nerve injury."
    }
  ],

  // 9. Posterior Cervical Fusion With Instrumentation
  "posterior-cervical-fusion-with-instrumentation-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Why is instrumentation used in cervical fusion?",
      answer: "<strong>Instrumentation</strong> (screws and rods) acts as an internal brace, holding the cervical spine rigidly in place immediately after surgery. This drastically increases the <strong>fusion success rate</strong> compared to using bone graft alone."
    },
    {
      question: "How long do I wear a collar after posterior cervical fusion?",
      answer: "Patients typically wear a rigid cervical collar for <strong>6 to 12 weeks</strong> after posterior fusion. This prevents neck motion and supports the heavy head while the posterior muscles heal."
    },
    {
      question: "Is posterior cervical fusion more painful than anterior?",
      answer: "Yes, <strong>posterior cervical fusion</strong> is generally more painful than anterior (ACDF) surgery because it involves dissecting the thick muscles at the back of the neck. Muscle spasms are common but managed with medication and therapy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can the hardware be removed later?",
      answer: "Hardware is rarely removed unless it causes irritation, infection, or breaks. In most cases, the titanium screws and rods remain in the body permanently without issues."
    }
  ],

  // 10. Posterior Cervical Fusion Surgery
  "posterior-cervical-fusion-surgery": [
    {
      question: "When is posterior cervical fusion recommended?",
      answer: "It is recommended for conditions that cannot be treated from the front, such as multilevel <strong>cervical stenosis</strong>, ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), or to repair a <strong>pseudarthrosis</strong> (failed fusion) from a previous anterior surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for posterior cervical fusion?",
      answer: "Full recovery takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>. Patients usually return to desk work in 4-6 weeks but must avoid heavy lifting or overhead work for at least 3 months."
    },
    {
      question: "Does this surgery correct neck deformity?",
      answer: "Yes, <strong>posterior cervical fusion</strong> is excellent for correcting <strong>cervical kyphosis</strong> (forward hunching of the neck) and restoring proper alignment to relieve strain on the spinal cord."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks?",
      answer: "Risks include C5 nerve palsy (temporary shoulder weakness), infection, and wound healing issues. Smoking significantly increases the risk of complications and non-union."
    }
  ],

  // 11. Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion
  "anterior-cervical-corpectomy-and-fusion": [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between ACDF and ACCF?",
      answer: "ACDF removes just the disc, while <strong>ACCF (Anterior Cervical Corpectomy and Fusion)</strong> removes the disc and the vertebral bone. ACCF is used when spinal cord compression extends behind the bone itself."
    },
    {
      question: "Is cervical corpectomy dangerous?",
      answer: "While it is a higher-risk procedure than ACDF due to the extent of bone removal, it is highly effective for preventing paralysis in patients with severe <strong>cervical myelopathy</strong>. Intraoperative monitoring makes it safer."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a plate for corpectomy?",
      answer: "Yes, a metal plate is screwed into the vertebrae above and below the removed bone to hold the graft or cage in place. This provides immediate stability for the <strong>cervical spine</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the hospital stay?",
      answer: "The stay is typically <strong>2 to 4 days</strong>. Swallowing difficulty (dysphagia) is a common temporary side effect that is monitored closely before discharge."
    }
  ],

  // 12. ACDF Surgery
  "acdf-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for ACDF surgery?",
      answer: "Most patients recover from <strong>ACDF surgery</strong> within <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong> for light activities. Full bone fusion takes 3 to 6 months. Arm pain relief is often immediate, while neck muscle strength returns gradually."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the permanent restrictions after ACDF surgery?",
      answer: "There are typically few <strong>permanent restrictions</strong> once the fusion is solid. Patients are advised to avoid high-impact sports like football to protect the adjacent levels, but can return to gym workouts, running, and swimming."
    },
    {
      question: "How serious is ACDF surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>ACDF</strong> is a common and highly successful spine surgery. While 'major' because it involves the spine, it is often performed as an outpatient procedure with a low complication rate."
    },
    {
      question: "Does ACDF limit neck movement?",
      answer: "A single-level ACDF results in very little loss of motion. Even with 2 or 3 levels fused, patients are often surprised by how much neck mobility they retain because the unfused segments compensate."
    }
  ],

  // 13. Lumbar Disc Replacement Surgery
  "lumbar-disc-replacement-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Am I a candidate for lumbar disc replacement?",
      answer: "Ideal candidates are generally under 60, have <strong>single-level degenerative disc disease</strong>, and have no significant arthritis in the facet joints. It is designed to preserve motion in active patients."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a lumbar disc replacement last?",
      answer: "Modern artificial discs are tested to last <strong>40+ years</strong>. Unlike hip or knee replacements, they do not bear the full weight of the body in the same way, leading to excellent long-term durability."
    },
    {
      question: "Is disc replacement better than fusion?",
      answer: "For the right patient, <strong>disc replacement</strong> is superior because it preserves spinal motion and reduces the risk of adjacent level degeneration. However, if the joints are arthritic, fusion is the better option."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time?",
      answer: "Recovery is faster than fusion because there is no bone graft to heal. Patients often return to non-impact activities in <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> and full sports in <strong>3 months</strong>."
    }
  ],

  // 14. Artificial Disc Replacement Surgery
  "artificial-disc-replacement-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Does insurance cover artificial disc replacement?",
      answer: "Yes, most major insurance plans and Medicare cover <strong>artificial disc replacement</strong> for the cervical spine (neck). Coverage for lumbar (back) replacement is becoming more common but varies by policy."
    },
    {
      question: "Can an artificial disc slip out?",
      answer: "Implant migration is extremely rare. The artificial disc is anchored into the bone. Over time, the bone grows into the surface of the implant (osseointegration), locking it permanently in place."
    },
    {
      question: "What materials are artificial discs made of?",
      answer: "Most devices use a combination of medical-grade <strong>titanium</strong>, cobalt-chromium alloy, and high-density polyethylene (plastic) to mimic the natural movement and shock absorption of a healthy disc."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it reversible?",
      answer: "While technically reversible, removing an artificial disc is complex. If a replacement fails, it is typically converted to a <strong>spinal fusion</strong> rather than replaced with another device."
    }
  ],

  // 15. Cervical Disc Arthroplasty
  "cervical-disc-arthroplasty": [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between ACDF and arthroplasty?",
      answer: "ACDF fuses the bones together, stopping motion. <strong>Cervical Disc Arthroplasty</strong> replaces the damaged disc with a movable implant, maintaining natural neck motion and reducing stress on other discs."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is eligible for cervical disc arthroplasty?",
      answer: "Patients with 1 or 2 levels of herniated discs causing arm pain (radiculopathy) who do not have severe arthritis, instability, or osteoporosis are excellent candidates."
    },
    {
      question: "How soon can I drive after cervical arthroplasty?",
      answer: "Most patients can drive within <strong>1 to 2 weeks</strong>, once they can turn their head comfortably and are off narcotic pain medication."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate?",
      answer: "Success rates are very high (<strong>over 90%</strong>) for relief of arm pain. Studies show it provides equivalent or better outcomes than fusion with fewer long-term complications."
    }
  ],

  // 16. Motion Preservation Spine Surgery
  "motion-preservation-spine-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What types of motion preservation surgery exist?",
      answer: "The main types include <strong>Artificial Disc Replacement</strong>, <strong>Posterior Cervical Laminoplasty</strong> (opening space without fusion), and <strong>Dynamic Stabilization</strong> systems. These preserve natural spine mechanics."
    },
    {
      question: "Why choose motion preservation?",
      answer: "The primary goal is to prevent <strong>Adjacent Segment Disease</strong>. By keeping the treated level moving, stress is not transferred to the discs above and below, preserving the overall health of the spine."
    },
    {
      question: "Is motion preservation surgery safe?",
      answer: "Yes, these are FDA-approved procedures with extensive clinical data supporting their safety and efficacy, particularly for younger patients wishing to maintain an active lifestyle."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play sports after motion preservation surgery?",
      answer: "Yes, one of the biggest advantages is the ability to return to sports like golf, tennis, and running without the stiffness associated with spinal fusion."
    }
  ],

  // 17. Total Hip Replacement
  "total-hip-replacement": [
    {
      question: "What are the lifetime restrictions after hip replacement?",
      answer: "Modern <strong>hip replacements</strong> have few restrictions. Doctors advise avoiding high-impact running or jumping. Low-impact activities like cycling, swimming, hiking, and golf are highly encouraged."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a total hip replacement last?",
      answer: "With modern ceramic-on-plastic bearings, <strong>total hip replacements</strong> can last <strong>20 to 30 years</strong>. This longevity makes surgery a viable option even for younger patients with severe arthritis."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the fastest way to recover from hip surgery?",
      answer: "The fastest recovery comes from <strong>early ambulation</strong> (walking the day of surgery) and strictly following physical therapy exercises. Choosing the <strong>Direct Anterior Approach</strong> often leads to faster early recovery due to muscle preservation."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I sleep on my side after hip replacement?",
      answer: "You typically need to sleep on your back or non-operative side with a pillow between your legs for the first <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong> to prevent dislocation while the tissues heal."
    }
  ],

  // 18. Total Knee Replacement
  "total-knee-replacement": [
    {
      question: "How painful is total knee replacement recovery?",
      answer: "<strong>Total knee replacement</strong> is known to be painful in the first 2 weeks due to the need for early movement. However, advanced <strong>nerve blocks</strong> and multimodal pain management have significantly reduced acute post-op pain."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I can walk without a walker?",
      answer: "Most patients transition from a walker to a cane within <strong>2 to 3 weeks</strong> and are walking unassisted by <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong>. Full strength and balance continue to improve for up to a year."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I kneel after knee replacement?",
      answer: "You *can* kneel, but it may feel uncomfortable or strange due to the lack of sensation in the scar or pressure on the implant. Using a cushioned kneeling pad usually solves this issue."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate?",
      answer: "The procedure is one of the most successful in medicine, with <strong>over 90%</strong> of patients experiencing dramatic pain relief and improved function for daily activities."
    }
  ],

  // 19. Posterior Cervical Laminoplasty
  "posterior-cervical-laminoplasty": [
    {
      question: "What is a laminoplasty?",
      answer: "<strong>Laminoplasty</strong> is a motion-sparing surgery where the lamina (roof of the spine) is hinged open like a door to create more space for the spinal cord, relieving compression without fusing the bones."
    },
    {
      question: "Is laminoplasty better than laminectomy?",
      answer: "For many patients, yes. Unlike laminectomy (which removes bone), <strong>laminoplasty</strong> preserves the bone and natural posterior tension band, reducing the risk of post-surgical instability and deformity."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time?",
      answer: "Recovery takes <strong>6 to 12 weeks</strong>. Patients wear a soft collar for comfort for a few weeks. Range of motion exercises begin early to maintain the preserved neck flexibility."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate?",
      answer: "Candidates are patients with <strong>cervical myelopathy</strong> involving 3 or more levels who do not have significant neck pain or kyphosis (forward curvature)."
    }
  ],

  // 20. Posterior Cervical Foraminotomy Surgery
  "posterior-cervical-foraminotomy-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What does a foraminotomy treat?",
      answer: "A <strong>posterior cervical foraminotomy</strong> treats <strong>radiculopathy</strong> (pinched nerve) by shaving away a small amount of bone and disc to enlarge the neural foramen, the tunnel where the nerve exits the spine."
    },
    {
      question: "Is fusion required with foraminotomy?",
      answer: "No, this is a <strong>decompression-only</strong> procedure. The stability of the spine is maintained, and no screws or rods are implanted, preserving full range of motion."
    },
    {
      question: "How minimally invasive is it?",
      answer: "It is very minimally invasive. It can often be done through a small tube (16-18mm) as an outpatient surgery, with patients returning to desk work in just <strong>1 to 2 weeks</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate?",
      answer: "Success rates for arm pain relief are <strong>85-95%</strong>. It is an excellent alternative to ACDF for patients with lateral disc herniations."
    }
  ],

  // 21. Lumbar Laminectomy Surgery
  "lumbar-laminectomy-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Does laminectomy weaken the back?",
      answer: "<strong>Lumbar laminectomy</strong> removes the lamina and spinous process. While it alters the anatomy, it does not cause instability in most patients. If instability is already present (spondylolisthesis), a fusion may be added."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to recover?",
      answer: "Recovery is relatively quick. Patients walk immediately and return to light activity in <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong>. Unrestricted activity is usually allowed after <strong>6 to 8 weeks</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my back pain go away after laminectomy?",
      answer: "Laminectomy is designed to treat <strong>leg pain (sciatica)</strong> and heaviness caused by stenosis. While it helps leg symptoms significantly, it may not relieve localized lower back pain caused by arthritis."
    },
    {
      question: "Can stenosis return after laminectomy?",
      answer: "Yes, over many years, bone spurs or disc bulges can reoccur at the same level or adjacent levels, a condition known as <strong>restenosis</strong>, potentially requiring further treatment."
    }
  ],

  // 22. Lumbar Decompression
  "lumbar-decompression": [
    {
      question: "What is lumbar decompression?",
      answer: "<strong>Lumbar decompression</strong> is a general term for procedures (laminectomy, discectomy, foraminotomy) that free compressed nerves to treat <strong>spinal stenosis</strong> or herniated discs."
    },
    {
      question: "Is lumbar decompression major surgery?",
      answer: "It ranges from minimally invasive micro-procedures to open surgery. Most isolated decompressions are considered <strong>moderate</strong> surgeries performed on an outpatient basis."
    },
    {
      question: "How do I sleep after lumbar decompression?",
      answer: "It is best to sleep on your back with a pillow under your knees, or on your side with a pillow between your knees. This relieves tension on the lower back nerves."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the restrictions?",
      answer: "The 'No BLT' rule applies: <strong>No Bending, Lifting (>10lbs), or Twisting</strong> for the first 4 to 6 weeks to prevent recurrent disc herniation or hematoma."

    },
    {
      question: "Does surgery cure degenerative disc disease?",
      answer: "Surgery does not 'cure' the disease, which is a natural aging process. Instead, it treats the painful symptoms by stabilizing the painful joint (fusion) or removing the source of pain (replacement)."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the best surgical options for DDD?",
      answer: "The gold standards are <strong>Spinal Fusion</strong> (for stability) and <strong>Artificial Disc Replacement</strong> (for motion). Intradiscal therapies and stem cells are also emerging as non-surgical options."
    },
    {
      question: "How successful is surgery for DDD?",

      question: "How long am I on crutches after hip arthroscopy?",
      answer: "Most patients use crutches for <strong>2 to 4 weeks</strong> to protect the repair, especially if the labrum was refixed to the bone. Weight-bearing is graduated slowly."
    },
    {
      question: "Is hip arthroscopy major surgery?",
      answer: "It is a minimally invasive outpatient surgery, but recovery can be lengthy. While the incisions are small, the internal repair requires <strong>3 to 6 months</strong> of rehab for full sports return."
    },
    {
      question: "Can hip arthroscopy prevent hip replacement?",
      answer: "Yes, by correcting impingement (FAI) early, <strong>hip arthroscopy</strong> can prevent further cartilage damage and potentially delay or eliminate the need for hip replacement later in life."

      question: "How painful is rotator cuff surgery?",
      answer: "It can be one of the more painful orthopedic recoveries due to the shoulder's sensitivity. <strong>Nerve blocks</strong> provide relief for the first 24 hours, and sleeping in a recliner is recommended for the first few weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the 'danger zone' of recovery?",
      answer: "The period between <strong>6 and 12 weeks</strong> is critical. The shoulder feels better, but the tendon is not fully healed. Doing too much too soon during this window can cause the repair to fail."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to heal completely?",
      answer: "The tendon heals to the bone in about 3 months, but full strength recovery takes <strong>6 to 9 months</strong>. Patience with physical therapy is key to a good outcome."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I lift my arm immediately?",

  "meniscus-repair-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Repair vs. Removal: Which is better?",
      answer: "<strong>Meniscus repair</strong> (stitching it) is better for long-term knee health as it preserves the shock absorber. Removal (meniscectomy) has a faster recovery but increases the risk of future arthritis."
    },
    {
      question: "How long on crutches for meniscus repair?",
      answer: "Because the repair needs protection, patients are often on crutches with limited weight-bearing for <strong>4 to 6 weeks</strong>, unlike the rapid return seen with removal."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate?",
      answer: "Success rates are <strong>80-90%</strong> for acute tears in younger patients. Success is lower for degenerative tears in older patients, where removal is often the preferred option."
    },
    {

    {
      question: "Which has a faster recovery: fusion or replacement?",
      answer: "<strong>Disc replacement</strong> typically offers a faster recovery (return to activity in 4-6 weeks) because there is no need to wait for bones to fuse together, unlike fusion which takes 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "Can fusion be converted to replacement?",
      answer: "No, once a spinal segment is fused, it cannot be 'unfused' and replaced. However, patients with a previous fusion can often have a replacement at a *new* adjacent level."
    },
    {
      question: "Which surgery is safer?",
      answer: "Both have similar safety profiles regarding the approach. <strong>Disc replacement</strong> has a lower risk of causing future problems at other spinal levels (adjacent segment disease)."
    },
    {
      question: "Why would a doctor recommend fusion over replacement?",
      answer: "Fusion is necessary if you have <strong>spinal instability</strong>, severe facet joint arthritis, deformity (scoliosis), or poor bone quality (osteoporosis), as replacement requires good bone and stable joints to function."

      question: "What is AxialIF (AxiaLIF)?",
      answer: "<strong>Axial Lumbar Interbody Fusion</strong> is a minimally invasive fusion of the L5-S1 level performed through a tiny incision near the tailbone. It avoids cutting back muscles or retracting nerves."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of axial fusion?",
      answer: "It offers minimal blood loss, very small scarring, and often less post-operative pain than traditional posterior fusion. It preserves the structural integrity of the spinal discs' outer walls."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time?",
      answer: "Patients often go home the next day. Walking is immediate. Fusion healing follows the standard <strong>6 to 12 month</strong> timeline, but functional recovery is faster due to the tissue-sparing approach."
    },
    {
      question: "Is everyone a candidate?",

      question: "What is hybrid cervical surgery?",
      answer: "It is a procedure combining <strong>ACDF (fusion)</strong> at one level and <strong>Cervical Disc Arthroplasty (replacement)</strong> at another. It treats multilevel disease by stabilizing the worst level while maintaining motion at the salvageable level."
    },
    {
      question: "Does hybrid surgery take longer?",
      answer: "The surgery time is slightly longer than a single-level procedure but is performed under one anesthesia session. It avoids the need for two separate surgeries."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the advantage?",
      answer: "It provides the 'best of both worlds': the reliability of fusion for severe degeneration and the motion preservation of replacement to protect the rest of the spine."
    },
    {
      question: "How is recovery compared to pure fusion?",

      question: "When does back pain require an MRI?",
      answer: "An MRI is needed if pain persists for more than <strong>6 weeks</strong>, or immediately if there are 'red flags' like leg weakness, numbness, fever, history of cancer, or loss of bowel/bladder control."
    },
    {
      question: "Do muscle relaxers help back pain?",
      answer: "Muscle relaxers can help acute spasms for a few days but are not a long-term solution. They often cause drowsiness and do not address the underlying structural issue."
    },
    {
      question: "Is heat or ice better for back pain?",
      answer: "Ice is generally better for the first <strong>48 hours</strong> of an acute injury to reduce inflammation. Heat is better for chronic stiffness and muscle spasms to increase blood flow."

    {
      question: "How long does it take to sit comfortably?",
      answer: "Sitting can be uncomfortable for <strong>3 to 6 weeks</strong>. Patients use a 'donut' or gel cushion and lean forward to keep pressure off the incision. Full recovery takes 3 to 6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the surgery dangerous?",
      answer: "The main risk is <strong>infection</strong> due to the location near the rectum. Surgeons use specialized dressings and antibiotics to minimize this risk. Nerve damage is rare."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I miss my tailbone?",

    {
      question: "Which graft is best for ACL reconstruction?",
      answer: "For young athletes, <strong>autograft</strong> (patellar tendon or hamstring) has the lowest failure rate. <strong>Allograft</strong> (donor tissue) is easier to recover from and is a good option for older patients."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the recovery?",
      answer: "The biological healing of the graft takes time. Return to running is usually <strong>3-4 months</strong>, but return to cutting sports (soccer, basketball) takes <strong>9 to 12 months</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the surgery arthroscopic?",
      answer: "Yes, it is minimally invasive. The surgeon uses small camera incisions to drill tunnels and place the graft, though a slightly larger incision is needed if harvesting your own tendon."

    },
    {
      question: "What is the main risk of XLIF?",
      answer: "The approach passes through the psoas muscle, which contains nerves. This can cause temporary <strong>thigh numbness or weakness</strong> in about 10-20% of patients, which usually resolves."
    },
    {
      question: "How fast is recovery?",
      answer: "Hospital stay is usually <strong>1 to 2 days</strong>. Patients walk immediately. Full recovery is faster than posterior fusion due to the muscle-sparing approach."
    },
    {
      question: "Can XLIF fix spondylolisthesis?",

  "facet-ablation-rhizotomy-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Does rhizotomy permanently kill the nerve?",
      answer: "No. <strong>Rhizotomy</strong> (Radiofrequency Ablation) burns the nerve to stop pain signals, but peripheral nerves can regenerate. Pain relief typically lasts <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery like?",
      answer: "There is virtually no recovery time. Patients may have a sore back for a few days (like a sunburn feeling inside), but can return to normal activities almost immediately."
    },
    {
      question: "Does it work for everyone?",
      answer: "It works best for patients whose pain was confirmed to be from the facet joints via a <strong>diagnostic nerve block</strong>. If the block worked, the ablation is likely to succeed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I have it done again?",

  "facet-block-ablation-rhizotomy-and-facet-fusion": [
    {
      question: "What is the difference between a block and ablation?",
      answer: "A <strong>block</strong> injects numbing medicine for temporary relief (diagnostic). An <strong>ablation</strong> uses heat to semi-permanently disable the nerve (therapeutic) for long-term relief."
    },
    {
      question: "What is facet fusion?",
      answer: "If ablation fails to provide lasting relief, <strong>facet fusion</strong> is a minimally invasive option where small wedges are placed into the facet joint to stabilize it permanently."
    },
    {
      question: "Is facet pain the same as sciatica?",
      answer: "No. Facet pain is usually localized to the lower back and may radiate to the buttocks/thighs but rarely goes below the knee. Sciatica shoots down the leg."
    },
    {
      question: "Are these procedures outpatient?",

    },
    {
      question: "Do all spine fractures need surgery?",
      answer: "No. Most stable compression fractures heal with <strong>bracing</strong> and rest. Surgery is needed for unstable fractures, burst fractures, or those causing severe pain/nerve issues."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a fracture take to heal?",
      answer: "Bony healing typically takes <strong>3 months</strong>. Pain relief from fixation surgery (like Kyphoplasty) is often immediate."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I walk with a spine fracture?",
      answer: "Depending on stability, yes. However, you should consult a spine specialist immediately. Walking with an unstable fracture can cause paralysis."

    },
    {
      question: "How is it performed?",
      answer: "A needle is guided via fluoroscopy (X-ray) through the sacrococcygeal ligament to the Ganglion Impar, a cluster of nerves in front of the tailbone."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it painful?",
      answer: "The area is sensitive, so local anesthesia is used. Most patients tolerate it well with only mild discomfort during the injection."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does relief last?",
      answer: "Relief varies. Some get weeks of relief, others months. It can be repeated, or followed by a neurolysis (using alcohol/heat) for longer duration."

    },
    {
      question: "What is 'text neck'?",
      answer: "Text neck is strain caused by constantly looking down at phones. It increases load on the cervical spine, leading to muscle spasms and premature disc degeneration."
    },
    {
      question: "Can sleeping wrong cause lasting pain?",
      answer: "Yes, sleeping without proper support can irritate facet joints. Using a <strong>contoured cervical pillow</strong> helps maintain neutral alignment."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I see a doctor?",
      answer: "See a specialist if pain persists >2 weeks, if you have arm weakness, numbness, or if the pain was caused by trauma (like a car accident)."

  "oblique-lumbar-interbody-fusion": [
    {
      question: "How is OLIF different from XLIF?",
      answer: "<strong>OLIF</strong> approaches the spine \"obliquely\" (in front of the psoas muscle), whereas XLIF goes through the muscle. This reduces the risk of thigh numbness/weakness associated with XLIF."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of OLIF?",
      answer: "It allows for a large cage placement for stability and correction of deformity while protecting the lumbar nerves. Recovery is faster than open posterior surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is the surgery?",
      answer: "The procedure typically takes <strong>1 to 2 hours</strong> per level. Patients usually stay in the hospital for 1 or 2 days."
    },
    {
      question: "Is OLIF suitable for L5-S1?",
      answer: "Typically no. The iliac crest (hip bone) blocks the oblique angle at L5-S1. ALIF or TLIF is usually preferred for that specific level."

    },
    {
      question: "How fast can I return to work?",
      answer: "Most patients return to normal activities in <strong>3 to 5 days</strong>. The recovery is significantly faster than open surgery because the palm skin is not cut."
    },
    {
      question: "Is it as effective as open surgery?",
      answer: "Yes, studies show it provides equivalent nerve decompression with the added benefits of less pain and faster recovery."

    },
    {
      question: "What is 'minimally invasive' surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Minimally invasive surgery (MIS)</strong> uses smaller incisions and specialized instruments to avoid cutting muscle. This leads to less pain, less blood loss, and faster recovery."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the risk of infection?",
      answer: "The risk is generally low (<strong>less than 1-2%</strong>) for elective orthopedic surgeries. Antibiotics are given before and after surgery to prevent this."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need physical therapy after surgery?",
      answer: "Yes. <strong>Physical therapy</strong> is crucial for breaking down scar tissue, regaining motion, and strengthening muscles to support the surgical repair."

      question: "How long does a hand fracture take to heal after surgery?",
      answer: "Bone healing typically takes <strong>6-8 weeks</strong>. Full strength and function recovery takes 3-4 months. Hand therapy accelerates recovery by restoring motion and preventing stiffness."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I have stiff fingers after hand fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Finger stiffness is a risk with any hand injury. <strong>Early motion</strong> (when the fracture allows) and hand therapy minimize this risk. Following your surgeon's motion protocol is essential for good outcomes."

    },
    {
      question: "How long is recovery from elbow fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Bone healing takes <strong>8-12 weeks</strong>. Full recovery of motion and strength takes 3-6 months. The elbow is prone to stiffness, so <strong>early motion is critical</strong> and therapy is essential."

    {
      question: "Why is physical therapy so important after elbow fracture surgery?",
      answer: "The elbow is highly prone to <strong>stiffness after injury</strong>. Without proper therapy, scar tissue can limit motion permanently. Therapy maintains motion gained during surgery and prevents contracture."

  "kyphoplasty": [
    {
      question: "Is kyphoplasty the same as vertebroplasty?",
      answer: "Similar procedures with one key difference: kyphoplasty uses a balloon to create space and potentially restore some vertebral height before injecting cement, while vertebroplasty injects cement directly. Kyphoplasty may provide better height restoration but both effectively stabilize fractures."
    },
    {
      question: "Will kyphoplasty fix my osteoporosis?",
      answer: "No, kyphoplasty stabilizes the fracture but doesn't treat the underlying osteoporosis. You'll still need medical management (calcium, vitamin D, bone-strengthening medications) to prevent future fractures."
    },
    {
      question: "How fast does pain improve after kyphoplasty?",
      answer: "Many patients experience significant pain relief within 24-48 hours as the cement stabilizes the fracture. However, results vary—some may take a week or more to notice improvement. Overall function typically improves within 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of kyphoplasty?",
      answer: "Risks include cement leakage (usually without symptoms), infection (rare), bleeding, nerve irritation, and adjacent level fractures. The procedure has a strong safety record when performed by experienced specialists using imaging guidance."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need physical therapy after kyphoplasty?",
      answer: "Sometimes. PT depends on your functional status and stability. Many patients benefit from gentle strengthening and balance exercises to prevent falls and improve bone health. Your specialist will determine if formal PT is needed."
    }
  ],
  "vertebroplasty": [
    {
      question: "Why choose vertebroplasty vs kyphoplasty?",
      answer: "Choice depends on fracture characteristics, anatomy, and surgeon preference. Vertebroplasty is simpler and may be preferred for flat fractures where height restoration isn't expected. Kyphoplasty may be chosen when height restoration is a goal. Both effectively stabilize fractures."
    },
    {
      question: "How is diagnosis confirmed before vertebroplasty?",
      answer: "Diagnosis requires imaging (X-ray, MRI, or CT) showing a compression fracture PLUS correlation between fracture level and your pain location. Sometimes a physical exam finding (tenderness over the fracture) helps confirm the painful level, especially if multiple fractures exist."
    },
    {
      question: "Can vertebroplasty be done for old fractures?",
      answer: "It's most effective for acute or subacute fractures (typically within 2-3 months of occurrence). Chronic fractures (more than 6 months old) may not respond as well since pain may be from other sources rather than fracture instability."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of vertebroplasty?",
      answer: "Risks include cement leakage into surrounding spaces (usually asymptomatic), infection, bleeding, nerve irritation if cement leaks toward nerves, and increased fracture risk at adjacent levels. Serious complications are rare with proper technique."
    },
    {
      question: "What aftercare is needed after vertebroplasty?",
      answer: "Activity guidance (gradual increase), pain management as needed, bone health optimization (medications, calcium, vitamin D), fall prevention strategies, and follow-up imaging to monitor healing and check for adjacent fractures."

      question: "PLIF vs TLIF—what's the difference?",
      answer: "Both are lumbar fusion techniques. PLIF (Posterior Lumbar Interbody Fusion) approaches from directly behind, accessing both sides of the disc space. TLIF (Transforaminal Lumbar Interbody Fusion) approaches from one side at an angle. Surgeon chooses based on anatomy and preference."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until I feel better after PLIF?",
      answer: "Varies significantly. Nerve pain (leg symptoms) may improve within weeks, but incisional pain can persist for 6-8 weeks. Bone fusion takes 3-6 months. Maximum improvement is often reached at 6-12 months post-surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need to wear a brace after PLIF?",
      answer: "Case-dependent. Some surgeons use braces for the first 6-12 weeks, especially for multilevel fusions or patients with poor bone quality. Others rely on the instrumentation (screws and rods) alone. Follow your surgeon's specific protocol."
    },
    {
      question: "What are common risks of PLIF surgery?",
      answer: "Risks include infection, bleeding, nerve irritation or injury, dural tear (spinal fluid leak), hardware complications, nonunion (failed fusion), and adjacent segment disease. Serious complications are uncommon but increase with multilevel fusions and patient comorbidities."

      question: "When can I return to work after PLIF?",
      answer: "Desk work: often 4-8 weeks. Light duty: 8-12 weeks. Heavy labor: 4-6 months or more. Timeline depends on job demands, number of levels fused, and individual healing. Avoid bending, lifting, and twisting until cleared by your surgeon."

  "thoracic-spine-surgery": [
    {
      question: "Is thoracic spine surgery common?",
      answer: "Less common than cervical or lumbar surgery because thoracic problems are less frequent. Thoracic surgery is performed for specific indications like spinal cord compression, fractures, deformity, or tumors. It requires specialized expertise due to proximity to vital structures."
    },
    {
      question: "What symptoms suggest thoracic spinal cord compression?",
      answer: "Balance problems, difficulty walking (wide-based or unsteady gait), coordination issues with hands or legs, band-like chest or abdominal tightness, and leg weakness or stiffness. These myelopathy symptoms indicate potential cord compression requiring prompt evaluation."
    },
    {
      question: "Will thoracic spine surgery relieve my pain?",
      answer: "Depends on pain cause. Surgery aims primarily to protect the spinal cord and prevent neurologic decline. Pain relief is a secondary benefit. Some thoracic conditions (fractures, deformity) cause significant pain that surgery can improve."
    },
    {
      question: "What is recovery like after thoracic spine surgery?",
      answer: "Varies widely based on procedure complexity and reason for surgery. Hospital stay may be 3-7 days. Brace use is common. Return to light activities takes 6-12 weeks; full recovery can take 6-12 months. Physical therapy is typically important."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need a second opinion for thoracic spine surgery?",

  "si-joint-fusion": [
    {
      question: "How do you confirm SI joint pain?",
      answer: "Diagnosis combines clinical exam findings (specific provocative tests) with response to diagnostic SI joint injections. If injection provides 50-75%+ temporary pain relief, it confirms SI joint as a primary pain generator. MRI helps rule out other causes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is SI joint pain the same as sciatica?",
      answer: "Can mimic sciatica but different source. SI joint pain is typically in the lower back, buttock, and back of thigh—usually not below the knee. Sciatica from nerve root compression often goes below the knee with numbness/tingling. Exam and injections differentiate them."
    },
    {
      question: "What if my MRI shows lumbar issues too?",
      answer: "Common scenario. The key is identifying the PRIMARY pain generator. Diagnostic injections (SI joint injection vs epidural) help determine which structure causes most pain. Treat the true pain generator first; other findings may be incidental."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is recovery from SI joint fusion?",
      answer: "Gradual improvement over 3-6 months. Early weeks involve activity restrictions and limited weight-bearing on the surgical side. Most patients notice meaningful improvement by 3 months, with continued gains through 6-12 months as fusion solidifies."
    },
    {
      question: "What are alternatives to SI joint fusion?",
      answer: "Continued physical therapy focusing on pelvic stability, repeated SI joint injections (every 3-6 months), radiofrequency ablation of SI joint nerves (less commonly performed), and activity modification. Fusion is reserved for confirmed SI pain failing comprehensive conservative care."

  ],
  "cervical-laminectomy": [
    {
      question: "Is cervical laminectomy the same as ACDF?",
      answer: "Different procedures with different approaches and indications. Laminectomy approaches from the back to remove bone and create space for the spinal cord (used for stenosis/myelopathy). ACDF approaches from the front to remove disc and fuse vertebrae (used for disc herniation or single-level stenosis)."
    },
    {
      question: "Will my myelopathy symptoms fully reverse after laminectomy?",
      answer: "Depends on severity and duration before surgery. Early treatment improves odds of recovery. However, goal is often to PREVENT WORSENING rather than reverse established deficits. Some improvement is common, but longstanding severe myelopathy may have permanent effects."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need fusion added to cervical laminectomy?",
      answer: "Depends on spine alignment and stability. If you have good neck alignment (normal lordosis), laminectomy alone may suffice. If you have kyphosis (forward curve) or instability, fusion may be added to prevent deformity progression. Surgeon assesses this preoperatively."
    },
    {
      question: "How long is recovery from cervical laminectomy?",
      answer: "Varies by number of levels and whether fusion is performed. Many patients resume light activities within 2-4 weeks. If fusion is added, recovery is longer (6-12 weeks for basic activities). Avoid heavy lifting and high-impact activities for 3-6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "What are red flags after cervical laminectomy?",
      answer: "Seek immediate care for worsening weakness (especially in legs), new bowel/bladder problems, increasing neck pain with fever (possible infection), severe headache when sitting up (possible spinal fluid leak), or numbness spreading to new areas."
    }
  ],
  "chronic-pain-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Why does pain persist even after imaging looks 'mild'?",
      answer: "Pain is multifactorial and doesn't always correlate with imaging severity. Factors include nerve sensitization, muscle dysfunction, joint mechanics, inflammation, and central pain processing. Effective treatment addresses the actual pain generators, not just imaging findings."
    },
    {
      question: "Are injections a cure for chronic pain?",
      answer: "Injections are both diagnostic and therapeutic—they help identify pain sources AND provide relief. They're part of a comprehensive plan, not a standalone cure. Combined with rehab and activity modification, injections can facilitate functional improvement."
    },
    {
      question: "What if I have pain in multiple areas?",
      answer: "Common in chronic pain. Strategy is to prioritize PRIMARY drivers (which pain limits you most?) and stage care appropriately. Treating the main pain generator often improves secondary pain as movement and function improve."
    },
    {
      question: "How long until improvement with chronic pain treatment?",
      answer: "Depends on pain duration and complexity. With a structured plan, many patients see measurable progress within 4-8 weeks. However, chronic pain that developed over years may take months to significantly improve. Focus is on functional goals, not complete pain elimination."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I see a specialist urgently for chronic pain?",
      answer: "Red flags include new or progressive weakness, numbness spreading proximally, loss of bowel/bladder control, severe pain with fever or unexplained weight loss, or pain after significant trauma. These warrant prompt evaluation to rule out serious underlying conditions."
    }
  ],
  "joint-pain-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Do I need an MRI for joint pain?",
      answer: "Not always. X-rays are often first-line for joint pain—they show arthritis, alignment, and bone issues. MRI is ordered when soft tissue injury (cartilage, ligaments, tendons) is suspected, symptoms don't match X-ray findings, or when considering surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "Are joint injections safe?",
      answer: "Yes, when properly indicated and performed. Risks include infection (very rare), temporary pain increase, allergic reaction, and potential cartilage effects with repeated corticosteroid injections. Benefits often outweigh risks when injections are used appropriately as part of a treatment plan."
    },
    {
      question: "When is surgery considered for joint pain?",
      answer: "When there's persistent functional limitation despite appropriate conservative care (typically 3-6 months), confirmed structural damage on imaging that correlates with symptoms, and pain/disability significantly impacts quality of life. Surgery is not based on imaging alone."
    },
    {
      question: "Can joint pain come from the spine?",
      answer: "Yes—referred pain is common. Cervical spine issues can cause shoulder pain; lumbar spine problems can mimic hip pain. Thorough exam differentiates between true joint pathology and referred spine pain. Sometimes both coexist and need addressing."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I do at home for joint pain?",
      answer: "Activity modification (avoid aggravators but stay active), appropriate exercises (low-impact cardio, strength training), ice for acute flare-ups or heat for stiffness, maintain healthy weight, and over-the-counter anti-inflammatories if cleared by your doctor."
    }
  ],
  "arthritis-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Is arthritis always 'bone-on-bone'?",
      answer: "No, arthritis exists on a spectrum. 'Bone-on-bone' is end-stage severe arthritis. Many people have mild to moderate arthritis with remaining cartilage. These earlier stages are very treatable with conservative care. Surgery is reserved for advanced arthritis causing significant disability."
    },
    {
      question: "Do injections rebuild cartilage for arthritis?",
      answer: "Current injections don't regrow cartilage. Corticosteroid injections reduce inflammation. Hyaluronic acid (viscosupplementation) may improve joint lubrication. PRP and other biologics show promise but aren't proven to regenerate cartilage. Injections provide symptom relief while cartilage preservation strategies (activity, weight) continue."
    },
    {
      question: "When is joint replacement recommended?",
      answer: "When severe arthritis symptoms (pain, stiffness, functional limitation) persist despite comprehensive conservative care (PT, medications, injections, activity modification), significantly impact quality of life, and X-rays confirm advanced joint degeneration. It's a quality-of-life decision, not an age-based one."
    },
    {
      question: "Can arthritis affect the spine?",
      answer: "Yes—facet joint arthritis causes axial back/neck pain; disc degeneration is a form of spinal arthritis. Spinal arthritis can lead to stenosis (nerve compression) as bone spurs and ligament thickening narrow the canal. Treatment is similar—start conservative, consider injections, reserve surgery for significant symptoms."
    },
    {
      question: "What's the fastest way to feel better with arthritis?",
      answer: "No single 'fastest' way—effective treatment is individualized. Combination approach typically works best: activity modification, targeted strengthening, weight management, appropriate medications, and possibly an injection for acute flare-ups. Starting with proper biomechanics plus pain control addresses root causes."
    }
  ],
  "bursitis-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Is bursitis the same as arthritis?",
      answer: "No, different structures. Bursitis is inflammation of fluid-filled sacs (bursae) that cushion around joints and tendons. Arthritis is cartilage breakdown within the joint itself. However, both can coexist and cause similar symptoms. Treatment approaches differ—bursitis responds well to injections and biomechanical correction."
    },
    {
      question: "Why does my bursitis keep coming back?",
      answer: "Recurrence usually indicates underlying biomechanical or overuse issues weren't fully addressed. Contributing factors include muscle imbalances, poor mechanics, training errors, or activities repeatedly irritating the bursa. Physical therapy targeting these underlying factors is key to preventing recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need imaging for bursitis?",
      answer: "Sometimes. Ultrasound can confirm bursa inflammation and guide injections. MRI is ordered if diagnosis is unclear or to rule out other issues (tendon tears, arthritis). Often, clinical diagnosis from exam is sufficient to start conservative treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "Will a cortisone injection cure my bursitis?",
      answer: "It can dramatically reduce bursa inflammation and pain, providing significant relief. However, injection alone doesn't address underlying mechanical causes. Combine injection with physical therapy, activity modification, and correction of contributing factors for best long-term results."
    },
    {
      question: "When should I see a specialist for bursitis?",
      answer: "If pain persists despite 2-4 weeks of rest and conservative home care, if you have significant weakness, if diagnosis is unclear, or if pain is worsening. Persistent or recurrent bursitis may need imaging, injection, and structured rehab program."
    }
  ],
  "tendonitis-treatment": [
    {
      question: "Is tendonitis always inflammation?",
      answer: "Not always. Acute tendonitis involves inflammation, but chronic tendon pain (tendinopathy) is often degenerative changes rather than active inflammation. This distinction matters—degenerative tendinopathy responds better to loading/strengthening exercises than to anti-inflammatories and rest alone."
    },
    {
      question: "Should I rest completely with tendonitis?",
      answer: "Short-term relative rest (1-2 weeks) to calm acute flare-ups, then progressive loading is usually best. Complete rest weakens the tendon. The key is finding the 'therapeutic window'—enough load to stimulate healing without aggravating symptoms. Physical therapy guides this process."
    },
    {
      question: "When do I need MRI for tendonitis?",
      answer: "If pain persists despite 6-8 weeks of appropriate treatment, if there's suspected tendon tear (sudden pain/weakness), if diagnosis is unclear, or when considering advanced treatments (PRP, surgery). MRI differentiates tendinopathy from tears and other issues."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does tendonitis recovery take?",
      answer: "Acute tendonitis may improve in 2-4 weeks with appropriate care. Chronic tendinopathy (tendinosis) takes much longer—typically 3-6 months of progressive loading exercises. Tendons heal slowly due to limited blood supply. Patience and consistency with rehab are essential."
    },
    {
      question: "Can tendonitis turn into a tear?",
      answer: "Yes, chronic tendinopathy weakens tendon structure, increasing tear risk. This is why early treatment addressing mechanics and load management is important. However, many people have tendinopathy visible on imaging without ever tearing. Proper rehab strengthens the tendon and reduces tear risk."
    }
  ],
  "osteoporosis-treatment": [
    {
      question: "How do I know if I have osteoporosis?",
      answer: "Bone density testing (DEXA scan) measures bone strength. T-score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis; -1.0 to -2.5 is osteopenia (low bone density). Risk factors include age over 50, female sex, family history, smoking, low calcium/vitamin D, and certain medications. Testing is recommended for women 65+ and men 70+, or younger with risk factors."
    },
    {
      question: "Can osteoporosis cause back pain?",
      answer: "Osteoporosis itself doesn't cause pain—it's 'silent' until fracture occurs. However, vertebral compression fractures from osteoporosis cause acute severe back pain. Chronic pain may result from multiple old fractures causing spinal deformity. Prevention and treatment of osteoporosis prevent these painful fractures."
    },
    {
      question: "Do I need spine surgery for osteoporosis?",
      answer: "Usually no—osteoporosis is primarily treated medically (calcium, vitamin D, bone-strengthening medications like bisphosphonates). However, if osteoporosis causes acute painful compression fractures not responding to conservative care, minimally invasive procedures (kyphoplasty/vertebroplasty) may be considered."
    },
    {
      question: "What is a vertebral compression fracture?",
      answer: "A compression fracture is collapse of a vertebral body, typically in the thoracic or lumbar spine, due to weakened bone from osteoporosis. It causes sudden severe back pain, often after minor trauma (bending, lifting) or even spontaneously. Can lead to height loss and spinal deformity if multiple levels fracture."
    },
    {
      question: "What can I do now to protect my bones?",
      answer: "Weight-bearing exercise (walking, jogging), resistance training, adequate calcium (1200mg daily for women 50+) and vitamin D (800-1000 IU daily), avoid smoking and excessive alcohol, fall prevention strategies at home, and bone density testing to guide medical treatment if needed."

      question: "What is hip labral repair surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Hip labral repair</strong> is an arthroscopic procedure that reattaches a torn hip labrum using suture anchors. The labrum is the cartilage ring deepening the hip socket. Surgery addresses the tear and any underlying <a href=\"/conditions/hip-impingement\">hip impingement</a> (FAI) causing it."
    },

    {
      question: "What is hip resurfacing?",
      answer: "<strong>Hip resurfacing</strong> is an alternative to total hip replacement that caps the femoral head with a metal surface rather than removing it. The acetabulum is also resurfaced with a metal cup. It preserves more bone than traditional replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for hip resurfacing?",
      answer: "Ideal candidates are <strong>younger, active males</strong> under 60 with good bone quality, large femoral heads, and hip arthritis. Women, patients with osteoporosis, kidney disease, or metal allergies are not ideal candidates due to higher failure rates."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of hip resurfacing over replacement?",
      answer: "Benefits include <strong>bone preservation</strong> allowing easier revision if needed, more natural hip biomechanics with larger head size reducing dislocation risk, and potentially better activity tolerance. However, long-term outcomes favor traditional <a href=\"/treatments/total-hip-replacement\">total hip replacement</a>."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of hip resurfacing?",
      answer: "Risks include <strong>metal ion release</strong> into bloodstream (metallosis), femoral neck fracture, higher revision rates in women, and all standard hip surgery risks (infection, dislocation, nerve injury). Metal sensitivity testing may be recommended."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does hip resurfacing last?",
      answer: "Survival rates are <strong>approximately 85-95% at 10 years</strong> in optimal candidates (young males). However, traditional hip replacements show better long-term outcomes. The procedure has declined in popularity due to concerns about metal-on-metal bearings."

  "hip-fracture-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What types of hip fracture surgery are there?",
      answer: "<strong>Hip fracture surgery</strong> varies by location. Femoral neck fractures may require hemiarthroplasty (partial replacement) or total hip replacement in elderly, or internal fixation in young patients. Intertrochanteric fractures use sliding hip screws or intramedullary nails."
    },
    {
      question: "How soon after a hip fracture should surgery occur?",
      answer: "Surgery should ideally occur <strong>within 24-48 hours</strong> after medical optimization. Early surgery reduces complications (pneumonia, blood clots, pressure sores) and mortality. Delays beyond 48 hours significantly increase complication rates in elderly patients."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you walk after hip fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Most patients begin <strong>walking with assistance within 1-2 days</strong> after surgery. Weight-bearing status depends on fracture type and fixation method. Hemiarthroplasty and nailing typically allow immediate weight-bearing, while some internal fixations require protected weight-bearing."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for hip fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Initial recovery takes <strong>3 to 4 months</strong> for basic mobility. Full recovery varies by age, health, and fracture type, taking 6-12 months. Elderly patients may not return to pre-fracture function. Physical therapy is crucial for regaining strength and preventing falls."

      question: "What is revision hip replacement surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Revision hip replacement</strong> is surgery to replace a failed or worn-out hip implant. Common reasons include loosening, infection, dislocation, fracture, wear, or instability. It's technically more complex than primary replacement with longer recovery."
    },
    {
      question: "When is revision hip replacement needed?",
      answer: "Revision is needed for <strong>persistent pain, implant loosening, recurrent dislocations</strong>, infection, component wear causing metallosis or osteolysis, or periprosthetic fracture. Some patients require revision decades after initial replacement due to normal implant wear."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does revision hip replacement take to heal?",
      answer: "Recovery typically takes <strong>6 to 12 months</strong>, longer than primary replacement. Patients use crutches/walker for 6-12 weeks. Physical therapy is more intensive. Some revisions requiring bone grafting or custom implants need extended protected weight-bearing."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of revision hip surgery?",
      answer: "Revision surgery carries <strong>higher risks than primary surgery</strong> including infection (2-5%), dislocation, nerve injury, blood loss requiring transfusion, bone fracture during component removal, and re-revision. Success rates are 80-90%, lower than primary surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you have multiple hip revision surgeries?",
      answer: "Yes, though each subsequent revision becomes <strong>more challenging</strong> due to bone loss and scarring. Modern techniques like trabecular metal cones, modular components, and bone grafting enable multiple revisions. However, outcomes decline and complication rates increase with each revision."

      question: "What is core decompression for avascular necrosis?",
      answer: "<strong>Core decompression</strong> is a joint-preserving surgery for early-stage <a href=\"/conditions/avascular-necrosis\">avascular necrosis</a> (AVN). The surgeon drills small holes into the femoral head to reduce pressure, stimulate new blood vessel growth, and slow bone death."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for core decompression?",
      answer: "Ideal candidates have <strong>early-stage AVN</strong> (pre-collapse stages) detected on MRI with minimal symptoms. Success rates are highest when performed before femoral head collapse. Late-stage AVN with collapse requires hip replacement rather than decompression."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of core decompression?",
      answer: "Success varies by AVN stage. <strong>Early-stage (Ficat I-II) success rates are 60-85%</strong> in slowing progression. Late-stage or post-collapse cases have poor outcomes. Younger patients and those addressing underlying causes (stopping steroids/alcohol) have better results."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for core decompression?",
      answer: "Patients use <strong>crutches with protected weight-bearing for 6-12 weeks</strong> to allow healing. Full recovery takes 3-6 months. Avoiding impact activities initially prevents femoral head collapse during healing. Serial X-rays monitor bone healing and potential progression."
    },
    {
      question: "What happens if core decompression fails?",
      answer: "If AVN progresses to femoral head collapse despite decompression, <strong><a href=\"/treatments/total-hip-replacement\">total hip replacement</a></strong> becomes necessary.

    },
    {
      question: "When is hip bursectomy recommended?",
      answer: "Surgery is considered after <strong>6-12 months of failed conservative treatment</strong> including physical therapy, injections, activity modification, and NSAIDs. Persistent pain limiting daily activities and sleep despite multiple injections indicates surgical candidacy."
    },
    {
      question: "What does hip bursectomy surgery involve?",
      answer: "The procedure removes the <strong>thickened, inflamed bursa</strong> and addresses underlying causes such as tight IT band (iliotibial band lengthening), gluteal tendon tears (repair), or bone spurs (removal). Addressing causative factors prevents recurrence."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for hip bursectomy?",
      answer: "Most patients resume <strong>light activities within 2-4 weeks</strong> and return to full activities by 6-12 weeks. Physical therapy focuses on IT band stretching, hip strengthening, and correcting biomechanical issues. Success rates exceed 85% when underlying causes are addressed."
    },
    {
      question: "Can hip bursitis come back after surgery?",
      answer: "Recurrence is uncommon after bursectomy as the bursa is removed. However, <strong>similar pain may return if underlying issues</strong> (IT band tightness, gluteal tears, leg-length discrepancy) aren't addressed. Maintaining hip flexibility and strength prevents recurrent symptoms."

      question: "What is partial knee replacement (unicompartmental)?",
      answer: "<strong>Partial knee replacement</strong> (unicompartmental arthroplasty) replaces only the damaged compartment (medial, lateral, or patellofemoral) rather than the entire knee. It's less invasive than <a href=\"/treatments/total-knee-replacement\">total knee replacement</a>, preserving healthy bone and ligaments."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for partial knee replacement?",
      answer: "Ideal candidates have <strong>isolated arthritis in one compartment</strong>, intact ligaments, minimal deformity, and are typically over 60. The procedure works best for medial compartment arthritis in lower-demand patients. Younger, active patients may be better served by total replacement."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the benefits of partial knee replacement?",
      answer: "Benefits include <strong>faster recovery (4-6 weeks vs 3 months)</strong>, more natural knee feel, smaller incision, less blood loss, shorter hospital stay, and better preservation of bone stock for future revision. Many patients report the knee feels more normal."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a partial knee replacement last?",
      answer: "<strong>Survival rates are 80-90% at 10 years</strong> and 70-80% at 15 years. However, 10-15% of patients eventually require conversion to total knee replacement due to arthritis progression in other compartments. Younger, heavier patients have higher revision rates."

      question: "What is meniscus surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Meniscus surgery</strong> treats <a href=\"/conditions/torn-meniscus\">torn meniscus</a> through arthroscopic repair (suturing the tear) or partial meniscectomy (removing damaged tissue). Repair is preferred in younger patients with repairable tears in the vascular zone. Debridement removes torn fragments causing mechanical symptoms."
    },
    {
      question: "When is meniscus repair recommended over removal?",
      answer: "<strong>Meniscus repair</strong> is preferred in younger patients (<40), acute tears, peripheral tears in the vascular zone, and vertical longitudinal tears. Repair preserves the meniscus, protecting against future arthritis. Success rates are 70-90% for appropriate repairs."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for meniscus surgery?",
      answer: "Recovery varies by procedure. <strong>Meniscectomy: 4-6 weeks</strong> for return to activities. Meniscus repair: 3-6 months with initial protected weight-bearing and limited motion to allow healing. Contact sports require full rehabilitation and strength return."
    },
    {
      question: "Can you walk immediately after meniscus surgery?",
      answer: "Walking depends on procedure type. <strong>Meniscectomy allows immediate weight-bearing</strong> as tolerated. Meniscus repair typically requires crutches with protected weight-bearing for 4-6 weeks to protect the repair. Your surgeon will specify your restrictions."
    },
    {
      question: "Will I develop arthritis after meniscus surgery?",
      answer: "Risk varies by procedure. <strong>Meniscus removal increases arthritis risk</strong> proportional to amount removed.

  "knee-ligament-repair": [
    {
      question: "What is knee ligament repair surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Knee ligament repair</strong> treats tears of the ACL, PCL, MCL, or LCL through reconstruction (using grafts) or direct repair. ACL tears typically require reconstruction. MCL and LCL tears may heal with bracing. Multi-ligament injuries need complex reconstruction."
    },
    {
      question: "Which knee ligament injuries need surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Complete ACL tears in active patients</strong> almost always require reconstruction. MCL injuries often heal non-surgically. PCL tears may be treated conservatively. LCL and multi-ligament injuries typically need surgery. Decision factors include activity level, age, and associated injuries."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for knee ligament surgery?",
      answer: "Recovery varies by ligament. <strong>ACL reconstruction: 6-9 months</strong> for return to sports. Multi-ligament reconstruction: 9-12 months. MCL repair: 3-4 months. Early rehabilitation focuses on motion and preventing arthrofibrosis, followed by progressive strengthening."
    },

      answer: "Tenodesis is recommended for <strong>chronic biceps tendonitis unresponsive to conservative treatment</strong>, irreparable SLAP tears (especially in patients >40), partial rotator cuff tears with biceps involvement, or painful biceps subluxation. It's often combined with rotator cuff repair."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for biceps tenodesis?",
      answer: "Recovery takes <strong>3 to 4 months</strong> for return to full activities. Patients avoid lifting with the affected arm for 6 weeks to allow tendon healing. Physical therapy focuses on shoulder motion initially, then progressive strengthening. Sports return requires 4-6 months."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the difference between tenodesis and tenotomy?",
      answer: "<strong>Tenodesis reattaches the tendon</strong> to bone preserving biceps function and cosmesis. Tenotomy simply releases the tendon, allowing it to retract. Tenotomy is quicker with faster recovery but may cause a \"Popeye\" deformity (20-30%) and potential cramping/weakness."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the results of biceps tenodesis?",
      answer: "Results are generally excellent. <strong>Pain relief rates exceed 85-90%</strong>. The \"Popeye\" deformity is rare (5%) compared to tenotomy (20-30%). Minimal functional strength loss occurs. Patient satisfaction is high, especially when combined with rotator cuff repair or other procedures."

  "shoulder-instability-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is shoulder instability surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Shoulder instability surgery</strong> stabilizes a chronically unstable shoulder through arthroscopic or open Bankart repair (labral repair with capsular tightening), capsular plication, bone grafting (Latarjet), or soft tissue reconstruction. Choice depends on bone loss and tissue quality."
    },
    {
      question: "Who needs surgery for shoulder instability?",
      answer: "Surgery is recommended for <strong>recurrent dislocations</strong>, especially in young, active patients after first-time dislocation, failed conservative treatment, significant bone loss (>20% glenoid or Hill-Sachs), or high-demand athletes/military personnel requiring reliable stability."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the Latarjet procedure?",
      answer: "The <strong>Latarjet procedure</strong> transfers the coracoid bone with attached muscles to the front of the glenoid, creating a bone block and sling effect. It's used for significant glenoid bone loss (>20%), failed prior soft tissue repair, or contact athletes."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for shoulder stabilization?",
      answer: "Recovery takes <strong>6 to 9 months</strong> for return to contact sports. Patients wear a sling for 4-6 weeks. Physical therapy progresses cautiously to avoid re-injury. Strengthening begins at 3 months. Full contact sports clearance requires 6-9 months with functional testing."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of shoulder stabilization surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Arthroscopic Bankart repair: 85-95% stability</strong> in first-time surgery. Latarjet procedure: 90-95% even with bone loss. Revision surgery has lower success (70-80%). Young contact athletes (<20 years) have higher re-dislocation risk (10-15%)."

  "acromioplasty": [
    {
      question: "What is shoulder acromioplasty?",
      answer: "<strong>Acromioplasty</strong> (subacromial decompression) is an arthroscopic procedure that removes bone spurs from the underside of the acromion and bursa to create more space for the rotator cuff. It treats <a href=\"/conditions/shoulder-impingement\">shoulder impingement syndrome</a>."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for acromioplasty?",
      answer: "Candidates include patients with <strong>chronic shoulder impingement</strong> causing pain with overhead activities that failed 3-6 months of conservative treatment (therapy, injections, activity modification). X-rays showing acromial spurs and MRI confirming impingement without large rotator cuff tears."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for acromioplasty?",
      answer: "Recovery takes <strong>3 to 6 months</strong> for full return to activities. Patients typically avoid overhead activities for 6 weeks. Physical therapy begins immediately with motion, progressing to rotator cuff strengthening. Most patients return to work in 2-4 weeks."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of acromioplasty?",
      answer: "Success rates vary widely. <strong>Properly selected patients: 70-85% satisfaction</strong>. Outcomes are best when combined with rotator cuff repair if tears exist. Isolated acromioplasty for impingement without tears has more variable results, with some studies questioning its efficacy."
    },
    {
      question: "Is acromioplasty still recommended?",
      answer: "Recent evidence questions <strong>isolated acromioplasty's effectiveness</strong> for impingement without rotator cuff tears, showing similar results to physical therapy alone. It's now primarily performed alongside rotator cuff repair. Conservative treatment should be exhausted before considering surgery."

  "shoulder-fracture-surgery": [
    {
      question: "What is shoulder fracture surgery?",
      answer: "<strong>Shoulder fracture surgery</strong> treats broken bones in the proximal humerus, clavicle, or scapula through open reduction internal fixation (plates/screws), intramedullary nailing, or hemiarthroplasty/reverse shoulder replacement for comminuted proximal humerus fractures in elderly patients."
    },
    {
      question: "When does a shoulder fracture need surgery?",
      answer: "Surgery is needed for <strong>displaced fractures, multiple fragments</strong> (3-4 part proximal humerus), fractures with rotator cuff injury, open fractures, neurovascular injury, or fractures in young, active patients. Many minimally displaced fractures heal non-surgically with immobilization."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time for shoulder fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Recovery varies by fracture type. <strong>ORIF fixation: 3-6 months</strong>. Reverse replacement for complex fractures: 4-6 months. Clavicle ORIF: 3-4 months. Initial immobilization lasts 4-6 weeks, followed by progressive motion and strengthening under supervision."
    },
    {
      question: "What determines if I need plates or shoulder replacement?",
      answer: "Decision factors include <strong>fracture pattern, bone quality, patient age, and function</strong>. Young patients with good bone: ORIF fixation. Elderly with osteoporotic 4-part fractures: reverse shoulder replacement often provides better outcomes than attempting fixation of poor-quality bone."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the complications of shoulder fracture surgery?",
      answer: "Complications include <strong>stiffness (most common)</strong>, avascular necrosis of the humeral head (10-20% in complex fractures), malunion, nonunion, hardware irritation, infection, nerve injury (axillary nerve), and potential need for revision to shoulder replacement."

  "sacroiliac-joint-injection": [
    {
      question: "What is a sacroiliac joint injection?",
      answer: "A <strong>sacroiliac (SI) joint injection</strong> delivers corticosteroid and anesthetic into the SI joint to reduce inflammation and diagnose SI joint dysfunction. It's performed under fluoroscopic (X-ray) guidance to ensure accurate needle placement. The procedure is both diagnostic and therapeutic."
    },
    {
      question: "Who is a candidate for SI joint injection?",
      answer: "Candidates include patients with <strong>lower back or buttock pain</strong> suspected from SI joint dysfunction, pain not responding to physical therapy, pain with provocative tests (FABER, Gaenslen's), or to confirm SI joint as pain source before considering <a href=\"/treatments/si-joint-fusion\">SI joint fusion</a>."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the recovery time after SI joint injection?",
      answer: "Most patients resume normal activities <strong>within 24-48 hours</strong>. Initial soreness from the needle resolves in 1-2 days. The steroid's full effect develops over 3-7 days. Relief typically lasts 3-6 months, sometimes longer. Multiple injections may be needed."
    },
    {
      question: "How effective are SI joint injections?",
      answer: "Diagnostic accuracy is high, with <strong>75%+ relief confirming SI joint</strong> as pain source. Therapeutic relief varies: 50-80% experience significant pain reduction lasting months. Combining injections with physical therapy strengthening core and hips provides better long-term results."
    },
    {
      question: "What are the risks of SI joint injection?",
      answer: "Risks are minimal. Possible complications include <strong>temporary pain increase (2-3 days)</strong>, infection (rare <1%), allergic reaction, bleeding, nerve injury (very rare), and temporary leg weakness. Fluoroscopic guidance minimizes complications."
    }
  ],
  "nerve-block-injection": [
    {
      question: "What is a nerve block injection?",
      answer: "A <strong>nerve block injection</strong> delivers anesthetic (and sometimes steroid) near specific nerves to interrupt pain signals. Types include medial branch blocks (facet joints), selective nerve root blocks (radiculopathy), peripheral nerve blocks, and sympathetic blocks. Both diagnostic and therapeutic."
    },
    {
      question: "What conditions are treated with nerve blocks?",
      answer: "Nerve blocks treat <strong>facet joint arthritis, radiculopathy</strong>, complex regional pain syndrome, neuralgia, chronic pain, and post-surgical pain. They help diagnose pain sources and predict response to permanent treatments like ablation or surgery."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does a nerve block last?",
      answer: "Duration varies by type and medication used. <strong>Diagnostic blocks (local anesthetic only): hours</strong>. Therapeutic blocks (with steroid): weeks to months. Radiofrequency ablation following successful blocks provides 6-12+ months relief. Some patients need repeat procedures."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the success rate of nerve blocks?",
      answer: "<strong>Success rates vary by condition: 60-90%</strong> depending on accurate diagnosis and block type. Medial branch blocks for facet pain: 70-80% response. Selective nerve root blocks: 50-75%. Blocks work best when pain has a clear nerve distribution."
    },
    {
      question: "Are nerve blocks safe?",
      answer: "Yes, nerve blocks are generally <strong>very safe when performed by experienced specialists</strong> using fluoroscopic or ultrasound guidance.

Treatment is tailored to sport demands, injury type, and athlete goals."
    },
    {
      question: "When should an athlete see a sports medicine specialist?",
      answer: "See a specialist for <strong>pain limiting performance or practice participation</strong>, suspected fractures or ligament tears, swelling not resolving in 72 hours, recurrent injuries, or desire to optimize recovery and prevent re-injury. Early evaluation prevents chronic problems."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I play through a sports injury?",
      answer: "Playing through <strong>sharp pain or pain altering mechanics</strong> risks worsening injury. Mild soreness may allow modified training. The key question: does pain affect performance or technique? If yes, rest and evaluation are needed. \"Toughness\" leads to prolonged recovery."
    },
    {
      question: "What is the typical recovery timeline for sports injuries?",
      answer: "Recovery varies widely. <strong>Mild sprains: 2-4 weeks</strong>. Moderate injuries (partial tears, tendonitis): 6-12 weeks. Severe injuries (complete tears, fractures): 3-6 months. Surgical cases: 6-12 months. Return-to-sport requires meeting functional milestones, not arbitrary timelines."
    },
    {
      question: "How can athletes prevent re-injury?",
