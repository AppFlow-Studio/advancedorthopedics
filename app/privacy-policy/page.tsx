                <p>
                  We sometimes use the non-personally identifiable information that we collect to improve the design and
                  content of our site and to enable us to personalize your Internet experience. We also may use this

                  cannot assure you that personally identifiable information that we collect will never be disclosed in a
                  manner that is inconsistent with this Privacy Notice. Inadvertent disclosures may result, for example,
                  when third parties misrepresent their identities in asking the site for access to personally
                  identifiable information about themselves for purposes of correcting possible factual errors in the
                  data.
