    q: "What should I do right after a work injury?",
    a: "If you are hurt at work, get to a safe place, report the incident to your supervisor, and seek medical evaluation as soon as possible. Even if the pain seems mild, documenting the injury early helps protect your health and your claim. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, we evaluate work-related spine, joint, and extremity injuries and outline a clear next-step plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "Which doctor should I see for a work-related injury?",
    a: "For suspected spine, joint, or fracture injuries, an orthopedic and spine specialist is usually the best first stop. Our board-certified physicians focus on work injuries that affect the back, neck, shoulders, hips, knees, hands, and feet, and they help you understand what can safely heal with conservative care versus what may need more advanced treatment.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need to report my work injury the same day?",
    a: "You should report a work injury to your employer as soon as possible. Many workers’ compensation policies expect notice within days of the incident. We encourage you to document when, where, and how the injury happened and to bring any incident reports with you to your appointment at Mountain Spine & Orthopedics.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a minor strain or sprain at work turn into a serious problem later?",
    a: "Yes. What feels like a simple strain can sometimes hide disc injuries, joint damage, or fractures that show up days later. Warning signs include worsening pain, new numbness or weakness, trouble walking, or difficulty using the injured limb. Our team uses a focused exam and imaging when needed to rule out serious problems early.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will you coordinate with my employer or workers’ compensation carrier?",
    a: "Yes. With your permission, we provide work status notes, restrictions, and detailed medical records for your employer, adjuster, or case manager. Mountain Spine & Orthopedics regularly treats workers’ compensation cases across FL, NJ, NY & PA and understands the documentation and follow-up these claims require.",
  },
  {
    q: "What if I already went to urgent care or the ER for my work injury?",
    a: "That is very common. Emergency rooms and urgent care centers focus on ruling out life-threatening problems, but they may not provide long-term orthopedic follow-up. Bring any X-rays, reports, or discharge summaries with you. Our specialists review what has already been done and then build a step-by-step orthopedic plan so you know exactly what comes next.",
