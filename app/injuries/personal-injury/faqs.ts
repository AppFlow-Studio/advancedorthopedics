    q: "When should I see an orthopedic specialist after a car accident or fall?",
    a: "You should be evaluated as soon as possible, even if the pain is mild at first. Spine, joint, and fracture injuries often declare themselves over days, not minutes. At Mountain Spine & Orthopedics, our team sees personal injury patients quickly across FL, NJ, NY & PA so we can document your injuries, order appropriate imaging, and start a clear treatment plan.",
  },
  {
    q: "What kinds of personal injuries do your orthopedic surgeons treat?",
    a: "We focus on injuries to the neck, back, shoulders, hips, knees, hands, and feet that result from car crashes, slip-and-fall accidents, or other trauma. That includes disc injuries, fractures, ligament and tendon tears, and joint damage that can limit your ability to work, drive, or sleep.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is it a problem if I already went to the ER or urgent care first?",
    a: "No. Emergency teams are designed to rule out life‑threatening issues, but they rarely provide long-term orthopedic follow-up. Bring any X‑rays, CT scans, or paperwork you received. Our specialists review what has already been done and then build a step‑by‑step orthopedic plan tailored to your injuries.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can a personal injury cause long-term spine or joint damage if I wait on treatment?",
    a: "Yes. Untreated disc injuries, fractures, and joint damage can lead to chronic pain, nerve symptoms, or arthritis. Warning signs include worsening pain, new numbness or weakness, difficulty walking, or trouble using the injured limb. Early evaluation with our orthopedic team helps protect both your health and your legal claim.",
  },
  {
    q: "Will you work with my attorney or insurance team?",
    a: "Yes. With your written permission, we provide clear visit notes, imaging reports, and work or activity restrictions to your attorney or claims team. Mountain Spine & Orthopedics routinely cares for personal injury patients across FL, NJ, NY & PA and understands the documentation, timelines, and follow-up these cases require.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do I need a referral before I can schedule a personal injury evaluation?",
    a: "In many cases, no referral is needed. Our intake team can help you schedule directly and verify your benefits. If your plan or attorney prefers a specific process, we coordinate with them so you can be seen quickly by an orthopedic and spine specialist.",
