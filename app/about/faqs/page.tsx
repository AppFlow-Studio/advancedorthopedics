        question: 'What is orthopedic surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Orthopedic surgery focuses on diagnosing and treating conditions affecting bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. At <Link href="/about" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Mountain Spine & Orthopedics</Link>, our Florida specialists use both surgical and non-surgical methods to relieve pain and restore movement.

        question: 'What is arthroplasty?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Arthroplasty is the reconstruction or replacement of a damaged joint — often the hip, knee, or shoulder — to restore mobility and reduce pain.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What is arthroscopic surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure using small incisions and a tiny camera to diagnose and treat joint problems. It allows for faster recovery and minimal scarring.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What is revision surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Revision surgery corrects or replaces a previous joint implant that has worn out or failed. It restores proper alignment and mobility.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What is minimally invasive spine surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Minimally invasive spine surgery uses advanced tools and smaller incisions to treat spinal conditions while preserving surrounding muscle tissue — resulting in less pain and a shorter recovery period.

          <p>
            Ask about your diagnosis, treatment options, recovery time, potential risks, and whether minimally invasive techniques are available. Our <Link href="/about/meetourdoctors" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Florida orthopedic surgeons</Link> ensure you're informed before any procedure.

        question: 'What should I bring to my orthopedic appointment?',

          <p>
            Bring your insurance card, photo ID, recent X-rays or MRI results, a list of medications, and any prior medical records. If under 18, a parent or guardian must be present. You can also submit your records through our <Link href="/find-care/free-mri-review" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Free MRI Review tool</Link>.

        question: 'Do I need a referral to see an orthopedic specialist?',

          <p>
            Most insurance plans don't require referrals, but it depends on your policy. Check with your provider or call our office for guidance. Review our <Link href="/insurance-policy" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">insurance policy page</Link> for more details.
          </p>

      },
      {
        question: 'When should I see an orthopedic doctor?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Schedule an appointment if you experience chronic back pain, joint stiffness, or limited range of motion. Early evaluation helps prevent further damage. Try our <Link href="/condition-check" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Condition Checker</Link> to assess your symptoms.

        question: 'How long does recovery take after orthopedic surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Recovery time depends on your condition and procedure. Many patients resume light activities within 6–12 weeks, with full recovery taking several months. Your surgeon will provide a personalized recovery timeline based on your specific treatment.
          </p>

        question: 'What kind of pain should I expect after orthopedic surgery?',

          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'Will I need rehabilitation after surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Often, rehabilitation is part of recovery. Your orthopedic surgeon may recommend exercises and activities to help restore strength, flexibility, and range of motion. Your provider will discuss the appropriate recovery plan for your specific procedure.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'How long do artificial joints last?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Modern joint replacements can last 15–20 years or longer, depending on your activity level and overall health. Proper care and regular follow-ups help maximize implant longevity.

            Yes. Many patients improve with non-surgical care such as <Link href="/treatments/epidural-steroid-injection" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">injections</Link>, medication, and bracing before surgery is considered.

          <p>
            Delaying surgery may cause pain, stiffness, and worsening joint damage. Early intervention often prevents complications and leads to faster recovery. Consider getting a <Link href="/find-care/second-opinion" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">second opinion</Link> to explore all your options.
