        question: 'What is orthopedic surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Orthopedic surgery focuses on diagnosing and treating conditions affecting bones, joints, muscles, ligaments, and tendons. At <Link href="/about" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Mountain Spine & Orthopedics</Link>, our Florida specialists use both surgical and non-surgical methods to relieve pain and restore movement.

        question: 'What is arthroplasty?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Arthroplasty is the reconstruction or replacement of a damaged joint — often the hip, knee, or shoulder — to restore mobility and reduce pain.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What is arthroscopic surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Arthroscopic surgery is a minimally invasive procedure using small incisions and a tiny camera to diagnose and treat joint problems. It allows for faster recovery and minimal scarring.
          </p>
        ),

      {
        question: 'What is revision surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Revision surgery corrects or replaces a previous joint implant that has worn out or failed. It restores proper alignment and mobility.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'What is minimally invasive spine surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Minimally invasive spine surgery uses advanced tools and smaller incisions to treat spinal conditions while preserving surrounding muscle tissue — resulting in less pain and a shorter recovery period.

          <p>
            Ask about your diagnosis, treatment options, recovery time, potential risks, and whether minimally invasive techniques are available. Our <Link href="/about/meetourdoctors" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Florida orthopedic surgeons</Link> ensure you're informed before any procedure.

You can also submit your records through our <Link href="/find-care/free-mri-review" className="text-blue-600 hover:underline">Free MRI Review tool</Link>.

        question: 'Do I need a referral to see an orthopedic specialist?',

      },
      {
        question: 'When should I see an orthopedic doctor?',
        answer: (
          <p>

      },
      {
        question: 'Will I need physical therapy after surgery?',
        answer: (
          <p>
            Yes. Physical therapy helps restore strength, flexibility, and range of motion. Your orthopedic surgeon will customize a program based on your progress and recovery goals.
          </p>
        ),
      },
      {
        question: 'How long do artificial joints last?',
        answer: (
          <p>
